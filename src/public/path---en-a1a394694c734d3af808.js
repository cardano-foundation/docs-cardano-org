Cardano\nSL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper\n<a href="https://iohk.io/research/papers/#9BKRHCSI">"Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol"</a>\nby Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.</p>\n<p>You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s\ndesign flaws. Please read <a href="https://en/cardanodocs.com/introduction/#what-makes-cardano-sl-special">"What Makes Cardano SL Special?"</a>\nfor more information about similarities and differences between Cardano SL and Bitcoin.</p>\n<!-- CARDANO_SL_README_END_1 -->\n<h2>Cryptocurrency Basics</h2>\n<p>Before giving a definition of a cryptocurrency, let\'s talk about why we care\nabout digital currencies in general and cryptographic currencies in particular.</p>\n<h3>Why Do We Care?</h3>\n<h4>Speed</h4>\n<p>As opposed to conventional (also known as fiat), centrally banked currencies,\nsuch as the Yen or the American Dollar, digital currencies do not require a\nbanking system to move value. With this restriction lifted, working with digital\ncurrencies is much faster than working with banking, especially on a global\nscale. Transferring 10 USD from Osaka to Denver no longer takes days when a\ndigital currency is used. All transactions are made rapidly regardless of the\ndistance.</p>\n<h4>You Own Your Money</h4>\n<p>All that a commercial bank account owner is given is a promise of being paid a\ncertain amount of money within a reasonable amount of time after receiving a\npayout request. Banking systems also have limits to any volume of value being\nmoved, rendering an individual unable to withdraw or transfer large amounts\nquickly. In case of cryptocurrencies, the person who holds a special kind of\ninformation called <em>a secret key</em> can spend the money at will. No other entity\nhas a power to manipulate the value that a user owns.</p>\n<h4>Pseudonymity</h4>\n<p>One can have as many cryptocurrency addresses as they wish, receiving and\nspending money from different addresses as per their purpose. A merchant running\nan E-Commerce shop can have a set of addresses for receiving money and issuing\nrefunds, and a separate personal "wallet" for their own needs. A single interface is used\nto control all of these wallets, and there is no need to log in to several\npayment platforms, which makes the process very time-efficient.</p>\n<h4>Security</h4>\n<p>Your money is as secure as the <em>secret key</em> that allows spending it. This means\nthat storing your secret key on a USB flash drive in a safe is equivalent to\nhaving banknotes in a safe. Absolutely nobody can steal this money even by\ncarrying out a successful cyberattack.</p>\n<h4>Extensibility</h4>\n<p>Using an approach known as <a href="https://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf"><em>side\nchains</em></a>, general purpose\ncryptocurrencies such as Cardano SL or Bitcoin can enable domain specific\ncryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum Classic. This way, any innovation developed\nvia domain specific cryptocurrency can have participants who hold value in a\ngeneral purpose cryptocurrency. Examples of such applications are identity\nmanagement, gaming and gambling, and verifiable computations.</p>\n<h3>What is a Cryptocurrency?</h3>\n<p>Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography to\nmanipulate value. Cryptography provides a way to generate proof of genuine\nauthenticity of any kind of information. This is called <em>digital signing</em>. In\ncryptocurrencies we generate a ledger (a database which provides information on\nhow much money each address has) by signing and sending transactions to the\nnetwork and receiving blocks of confirmed transactions. Cryptocurrencies are\nnormally decentralized, meaning that many people from all over the globe\nparticipate in ledger generation by running cryptocurrency nodes. Thus, a\nconsensus about the state of the ledger has to be achieved. Two most significant\napproaches for achieving such consensus are discussed in the next section.</p>\n<h2>What Makes Cardano SL Special?</h2>\n<!-- v0.1.0.0 -->\n<p>While there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many\ndifferences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference\nis that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes\nuse of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and\nlong term participation.</p>\n<h3>Purpose of a Consensus Algorithm</h3>\n<p>Consensus algorithms are used to produce new transaction blocks, resulting in an\nupdated state of the ledger. Whenever someone publishes a block of transactions,\nthey — or rather, their node that runs the cryptocurrency protocol — have to\nattach a proof that they have merited it. Below two types of such proofs are\ndiscussed.</p>\n<h3>Proof of Work and Mining</h3>\n<p>Proof of work is the most common consensus algorithm type for cryptocurrencies.\nIt originated in Bitcoin, and this is how this cryptocurrency works. To generate\nproof of work, a computer has to solve a challenge. The challenge is a\ncomputationally heavy problem which is hard to solve, but the solution is easy\nto verify. When a computer on a proof of work based network finds a solution, it\npublishes it along with the transactions that the computer has been observing while\ncracking the problem. The owner of this computer collects the transaction fees\nand a reward for generating a block. The entire process is called <em>mining</em>.\nMining is very energy consuming, and the amount of energy needed is constantly increasing,\nwhich can lead to unsound competition.</p>\n<h3>Proof of Stake and Minting</h3>\n<p>Proof of stake is a novel approach to block generation. IOHK scientists led by\n<a href="https://iohk.io/team/aggelos-kiayias/">Prof. Aggelos Kiayias</a> have designed the\nfirst provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros. Ouroboros lies\nat the heart of Cardano SL. Research team has published a\n<a href="https://iohk.io/research/papers/a-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/">white paper</a>\nthat is a worthy read for anyone with a background in cryptocurrency theory. The\ncore idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking\ncomputationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a\nprobability proportional to the amount of coins this node has. If a node\nhas positive (> 0) <a href="/en/cardano/proof-of-stake/#stake">stake</a>, it is called <em>a\nstakeholder</em>. If a node eventually becomes chosen to mint a block, it is called <em>a\nslot leader</em>. You can read more about this process in <a href="/en/cardano/proof-of-stake/">Proof of Stake in Cardano\nSL</a>.</p>\n<!-- CARDANO_SL_README_BEGIN_2 -->\n<h2>Beyond Settlement Layer</h2>\n<p>Cardano SL is called "Layer" for a reason. It is the first component of\nthe Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer,\nserving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special\nkind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out\ncorrectly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for\nverifying honesty of random number generation and game\noutcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish\nsuch tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the\napplication of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity\nmanagement, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform.\nWe are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/daedalus">wallet application</a>,\ninto a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated\ncryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.</p>\n<!-- CARDANO_SL_README_END_2 -->',frontmatter:{path:"/en/introduction/",doc_title:"Introduction",author:null,date:"2017-01-01",language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"base"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/for-contributors/2017-01-03-haddock.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"Haddock Documentation Here you can find the Haddock-based documentation for Cardano SL.

As people\nwho purchased Ada redeem their coins, the stake will automatically get delegated\nto a pool of trusted nodes that will maintain the network. During this time no\nblock rewards will be issued — we will maintain the network pro bono. This is\nrequired because in order for the protocol to function properly, some of the\nstakeholders who jointly posses majority of stake have to be online, which in\nreality won\'t be the case during the first months of network operation.</p>\n<p>The Bootstrap era will lead to the <a href="/timeline/reward">Reward era</a>, during which\nupdates to the protocol will be issued, and the major stakeholders will be\nprovided with convenient options to run their nodes on personal servers in the\ncloud.</p>\n<h2>Stake Locking</h2>\n<p>The Bootstrap era is the period of Cardano SL existence that allows only fixed predefined\nusers to have control over the system. The set of such users (the bootstrap stakeholders)\nand propotion of total stake each of them controls is defined in genesis block.</p>\n<p>Purpose of Bootstrap era is to address concern that at the beginning of mainnet majority of\nstake will probably be offline (which breaks the protocol at the start). Bootstrap era is to be ended\nwhen network stabilizes and majority of stake is present online.</p>\n<p>The next era after Bootstrap is called <a href="https://cardanodocs.com/timeline/reward/">the Reward era</a>.\nReward era is actually a "normal" operation mode of Cardano SL as a PoS-cryptocurrency.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>During Bootstrap era stake in Cardano SL should be effectively delegated to a fixed set of keys <code>S</code>.</li>\n<li><code>S</code> = 7</li>\n<li>Stake should be distributed among <code>s</code> ∈  <code>S</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>At the end of Bootstrap era stake should be unlocked:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ada buyers should be able to participate in protocol themselves (or delegate their rights to some\ndelegate not from <code>S</code>).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each Ada buyer should explicitly state she wants to take control over her stake.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Otherwise it may easily lead to situation when less than majority of stake is online once Reward\nera starts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Before this withdrawing stake action occurs, stake should be still being controlled by <code>S</code> nodes.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Proposal</h3>\n<p>Let us now present the Bootstrap era solution:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Initial <code>utxo</code> contains all the stake distributed among Bootstrap stakeholders. Initial <code>utxo</code>\nconsists of <code>(txIn, txOut)</code> pairs, and every <code>txOut</code> contains an address with stake distribution in it.\nSo we just set distribution in a way it sends all coins to all Bootstrap stakeholders.</li>\n<li>While the Bootstrap era takes place, users can send transactions changing initial <code>utxo</code>. We enforce\nsetting stake distribution for each transaction output to spread stake to Bootstrap stakeholders in. This\neffectively makes stake distribution is system constant.</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is genesis state of heavyweight delegation. It contains pairs <code>(Issuer, ProxySK)</code>, where\n<code>Issuer</code> is an identifier of stakeholder who delegated and <code>ProxySK</code> is a proxy secret key for delegate.\nPlease note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>delegate must differ from an issuer in each pair, i. e. no revocations are allowed;</li>\n<li>delegate can\'t be an issuer, i.e. transitive delegation is not supported.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When the Bootstrap era is over, we disable restriction on stake distribution. Bootstrap stakeholders will\nvote for Bootstrap era ending: special update proposal will be formed, where a particular constant\nwill be set appropriately to trigger Bootstrap era end at the point update proposal gets adopted.\nSystem operates the same way as in Bootstrap era, but users need to explicitly state they understand\nowning their stake leads to responsibility to handle the node. To get his stake back user should\nsend a transaction, specifying delegate key(s) in stake distribution. It may be the key owned by user\nhimself or the key of some delegate (which may also be one or few of Bootstrap stakeholders).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please read about <a href="/technical/delegation/">Stake Delegation in Cardano SL</a> for more details about\ndelegation mechanism.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/en/timeline/bootstrap-era/",doc_title:"Bootstrap Era",author:null,date:"2017-01-01",language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"timeline"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/technical/2017-01-06-explorer.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"Cardano SL Explorer As  mentioned earlier , Explorer is a service for searching\ninformation about  transactions ,\n addresses  and time…",html:'<!-- Reviewed at ac0126b2753f1f5ca6fbfb555783fbeb1aa141bd -->\n<h1>Cardano SL Explorer</h1>\n<p>As <a href="/cardano/explorer">mentioned earlier</a>, Explorer is a service for searching\ninformation about <a href="/glossary/#transaction">transactions</a>,\n<a href="/glossary/#address">addresses</a> and time periods (<a href="/glossary/#epoch">epochs</a> and\n<a href="/glossary/#slot">slots</a>) in the Cardano network.</p>\n<h2>Explorer Backend Workflow</h2>\n<p>Explorer starts with\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/master/explorer/src/explorer/ExplorerNodeOptions.hs">CLI-options</a>.\nAll supported options can be viewed by <code>cardano-explorer --help</code> command.</p>\n<p>Then explorer <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/master/explorer/src/explorer/Main.hs">runs "internal"\nnode</a>\nvia <code>cardano-sl</code> library.

To do this, <code>cardano-launcher</code> uses two\nseparate tools: <a href="/technical/cli-options/#cardano-node"><code>cardano-node</code></a> and\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-updater"><code>cardano-updater</code></a>.</p>\n<p>Please see <a href="/technical/cli-options/#cardano-launcher"><code>cardano-launcher</code>\'s description</a>\nfor detailed information about available options.</p>\n<h2>Scenarios</h2>\n<p>There are two work scenarios for <code>cardano-launcher</code>: client scenario and server scenario.\nIf you provide a path to the wallet (e.g. Daedalus) using <code>--wallet</code> argument during\nstart, <code>cardano-node</code> will run in\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L178">client</a>\nscenario, otherwise it will run in\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L171">server</a>\none.</p>\n<h3>Server Scenario</h3>\n<p>After the start, there are 2 steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Running an updater.</li>\n<li>Running a node.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Updater\'s work is explained <a href="#updater">below</a>.</p>\n<p>A node is <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L280">spawning as a separate\nprocess</a>.\nAfter that we just <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L201">wait until the node\nstops</a>.\nAfter a node exits, its exit code is checked.

To do it, we must\nprovide two additional arguments during launcher\'s start: <code>--report-server</code> and\n<code>--node-log</code>. The first argument defines an URL of the report server, the second\none defines a path to the log file. We asynchronously <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L343">send log info to the\nreport server</a>.\nPlease note that the file from the <code>--node-log</code> argument must exist.</p>\n<h3>Client Scenario</h3>\n<p>As the process starts, there are 3 steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Running an updater.</li>\n<li>Running a node.</li>\n<li>Running a wallet.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For steps 1 and 2, see <a href="#server-scenario">Server Scenario</a> above.</p>\n<p>The wallet is <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L227">spawning as a separate\nprocess</a>.</p>\n<p>After that, we <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L228">wait until node or wallet\nstops</a>.\nWhen it stops, we check it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the node exits, we write a log (see <a href="#server-scenario">Server Scenario</a>\nabove for explanations) and <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L235">wait for the wallet\'s\ndeath</a>.</li>\n<li>If the wallet exits, we check the exit code, and if it equals <code>20</code>, we\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L242">kill the node</a>\nand <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L244">restart the launcher in the client\nscenario</a>.\nPlease note that killing the node isn\'t executed immediately; the node is\nkilled after some timeout, and its value is obtained from the\n<code>--node-timeout</code> argument mentioned above.</li>\n<li>If the wallet exits <em>and</em> exit code isn\'t equal to <code>20</code>, we\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L250">kill the node</a>\nimmediately.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Updater</h2>\n<p>Another important thing <code>cardano-launcher</code> does is updating a node.

The node update is a special <code>.tar</code>-archive: it\nrepresents the <em>difference</em> between the old (current) version of the node and a\nnew version of it. A path to this archive is obtained via <code>--update-archive</code>\nargument. So, <code>cardano-updater</code> applies this archive to the node, and after\nrestart a new version of the node can be used.</p>\n<p>Please note that when we run <code>cardano-launcher</code> in the client scenario, a wallet\'s\nuser is able to see that an update is ready, and there are two situations\npossible.</p>\n<p>If a user <em>agrees</em> to apply this update, the wallet exits immediately with an\nexit code <code>20</code>. In this case, as described above, launcher restarts the node and\nthe update is applied.</p>\n<p>If a user <em>doesn\'t agree</em> to apply this update, the wallet continues working.\nBut when it <em>is</em> restarted (sooner or later), that update <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L223"><em>will</em> be applied</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: the updater runs synchronously, we start it and then <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L269">wait for it to\nfinish</a>.\nIf the updater finishes its work\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/194f4876d7b72766f7fe72ed4a1fba828903cae0/src/launcher/Main.hs#L271">successfully</a>,\nthe<code>.tar</code>-archive is deleted.</p>\n<h3>Implementation Overview</h3>\n<p>For more implementation details about Cardano SL Update system please see <a href="/technical/updater/">this chapter</a>.</p>',

Every\nwallet, regardless of name, type and currency, must have the said fields.</p>\n<h2>Transactions and Wallets</h2>\n<p>In the <a href="/cardano/transactions/">Transactions</a> section, the structure of\ntransactions is defined. However, to facilitate client operations, transactions\nare represented differently in clients. They are represented as</p>\n<pre><code class="language-haskell">data CTx = CTx\n    { ctId            :: CTxId\n    , ctAmount        :: CCoin\n    , ctConfirmations :: Word\n    , ctMeta          :: CTxMeta\n    , ctInputAddrs    :: [CAddress Acc]\n    , ctOutputAddrs   :: [CAddress Acc]\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Essentially, a client transaction is composed by the actual transaction <code>Id</code>, by\nthe amount the wallet in question received, the number of confirmations this\ntransaction has received (i.e., the number of blocks that are currently on top\nof the block containing the transaction in question), input and output\naddresses. Meta-information - the datatype <code>CTxMeta</code> - indicates the\ntransaction\'s currency, its title or name, its description and the\nPOSIX-formatted date of sending it.</p>\n<h2>Wallet Backend API</h2>\n<p>Currently, the wallet\'s API provides a series of methods to work with wallets.\nThe <code>servant</code> Haskell library that provides a modular approach to API-building\nis used. This library uses combinators both to build atomic HTTP actions and to\nglue these atomic methods together to form larger and more complete APIs.</p>\n<p>The wallet web API is enabled by default. It uses the <code>IP:PORT</code> specified with a\n<code>--wallet-address</code> option (defaults to: <code>127.0.0.1:8090</code>).</p>\n<p>Documentation for wallet web API is available\n<a href="/technical/wallet/api/v0">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>TLS Connections</h3>\n<p>The Wallet Web API uses TLS for secure communication. Calls to the API need\nto send a client CA certificate that was used when launching the node and\nidentifies the client as being permitted to invoke the server API.</p>\n<p>Note that the client certificate file is the one which was supplied as the\n<code>--tlsca</code> option, when launching the node.</p>\n<p>For example, If that file is available as <code>ca.crt</code>, then a curl call to a node\nrunning on <code>localhost:8090</code> can be made like so -</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">curl --cacert ca.crt -v https://localhost:8090/api/settings/sync/progress\n</code></pre>\n<p>If that request succeeds, then you have configured TLS properly.</p>\n<h3>Handling errors</h3>\n<p>If the event requests fail, there is a <code>WalletError</code> type, which is simply a\nwrapper over <code>Text</code> to show what happened.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/en/technical/cardano-sl-wallet-backend/",doc_title:"Cardano SL Wallet Backend",author:null,date:"2017-01-01",language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"technical"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/technical/2017-05-16-specification-wallet-backend.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"Formal specification for a Cardano wallet This document is a formal specification of a wallet for Cardano (or any UTxO-based cryptocurrency…",html:'<h1>Formal specification for a Cardano wallet</h1>\n<p>This document is a formal specification of a wallet for Cardano (or any UTxO-based cryptocurrency).

This will not allow an adversary to map all child addresses on the chain to\ntheir root as long as we do not actually store any funds on the root key (which\nis not forced by consensus rules, rather by UI).</p>\n<p><strong>Crucial point in wallet design:</strong> root public keys are not used to actually store\nmoney.</p>\n<h2>Use cases</h2>\n<h3>Financial audit</h3>\n<p>An auditor requires only the hash of a root public key in order to view all\nkeys / addresses in the hierarchy.</p>\n<h3>Payment server</h3>\n<p><em>This is applicable for <strong>non-hardened</strong> keys only.</em></p>\n<p>For a payment server to be able to derive subsequent addresses for receiving\npayments, one of the following is required on the server:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Root public key</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Payload of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Public key <code>PK</code> of level <code>i</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hash of root public key</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tree path for <code>PK</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Wallet</h3>\n<p>For a wallet to operate over some subtree, one needs to provide either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Root secret key</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Payload of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Secret key <code>SK</code> of level <code>i</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hash of root public key</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tree path for <code>SK</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<p>Let <code>A(K)</code> denote the address that holds information about keypair <code>K</code>.

The syntax is fairly Haskell-like, but\nunlike Haskell, the language is eagerly evaluated.</p>\n<h2>Declaring Data Types</h2>\n<p>In Plutus, to define a data type, we give the name of the type, then any type\nparameters, together with a list of constructor alternatives — like in Haskell.\nEach constructor alternative has the types of its arguments.</p>\n<p>So, for instance, the type of Peano numerals would be defined as</p>\n<pre><code>data Nat = { Zero | Suc Nat }\n</code></pre>\n<p>whereas binary trees would be defined as</p>\n<pre><code>data Tree a = { Leaf | Branch (Tree a) a (Tree a) }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The type constructor <code>Tree</code> takes one parameter, <code>a</code>. It's inhabited by values\nconstructed by two constructors, <code>Leaf</code>, which has no arguments, and <code>Branch</code>,\nwhich has three arguments, a left subtree of type <code>Tree a</code>, a value of type <code>a</code>,\nand a right subtree of type <code>Tree a</code>.</p>\n<p>We can inspect data using the <code>case</code> construct, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>case t of {\n  Leaf -> ... ;\n  Branch l x r -> ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Declaring Values</h2>\n<p>To declare a new value (whether it's a function or not), we provide its type,\nand then specify its value. For instance, to define addition for natural\nnumbers, we can give a recursive definition using <code>case</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>add : Nat -> Nat -> Nat {\n  add = \\m n ->\n    case m of {\n      Zero -> n ;\n      Suc m' -> Suc (add m' n)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can also use pattern matching equations in the same way as in Haskell, which\nmakes the definition of functions like this much more elegant:</p>\n<pre><code>add : Nat -> Nat -> Nat {\n  add Zero n = n ;\n  add (Suc m) n = Suc (add m n)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Smart Contract Computations</h2>\n<p>Plutus has one important type built into the language specific for smart\ncontract computations: the type constructor <code>Comp</code>, which takes one type\nparameter. The simplest way to make values is with the two computation\nconstructors <code>success</code>, which takes a value <code>M</code> with type <code>A</code> (for any choice of\n<code>A</code>) and produces a computation of type <code>Comp A</code> which represents a successful\nsmart contract computation that returns <code>M</code>. You can also build a value of type\n<code>Comp A</code> with just <code>failure</code>, which represents a failed computation.</p>\n<p>It's also possible to chain smart contract computations together using <code>do</code>\nnotation. Given a term <code>M</code> of the type <code>Comp A</code>, and a term <code>N</code> of type <code>Comp B</code>\nwith a free variable <code>x</code> of type <code>A</code>, we can form <code>do { x &#x3C;- M ; N }</code> which runs\nthe computation <code>M</code>, binds its returned value to <code>x</code>, then runs the computation\n<code>N</code>. If the term <code>M</code> computes to <code>failure</code>, then the failure is propagated by\nthe <code>do</code> construct and the whole thing computes to <code>failure</code>.</p>\n<p>This is most useful for building validator scripts for smart contracts. The\nstandard way of doing this is by asking for a redeemer program of type <code>Comp A</code>\nand a validator program of type <code>A -> Comp B</code>, which then are composed to form\n<code>do { x &#x3C;- redeemer ; validator x }</code>. The <code>redeemer</code> program is run, returning\nwhatever data <code>validator</code> needs, and then that data is given to <code>validator</code>\nwhich is then run.</p>\n<h2>More Detailed Overview</h2>\n<p>The other chapters in Plutus section provide a more detailed overview of the\ngrammar, types, and programs of Plutus, including the built-in types and\nfunctionality, and should be read before diving into writing programs. There's\nalso a demo file, showing the implementation of a number of common functions, to\ngive a good sense of the use of the language.</p>",frontmatter:{path:"/en/technical/plutus/introduction/",doc_title:"Introduction",author:null,date:"2017-01-01",language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"technical-plutus"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/technical/wallet/2018-03-14-api-docs.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"API Documentation V0 (deprecated) The API documentation for v0, now  deprecated , has been moved  here .

No matter whether a\nchange in proposal state comes from the network/mempool, or from loading the\nblockchain, <code>PollModifier</code> represents modification of global state which will be\nmade if one applies mempool.</p>\n<h3>Updating the Mempool</h3>\n<p>As nodes deserialize <a href="/technical/protocols/binary-protocols/#update-system">payloads of update system\nmessages</a>, they modify\nmempool as implemented\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/43a2d079a026b90ba860e79b5be52d1337e26c6f/update/Pos/Update/MemState/Functions.hs#L35">here</a>.</p>\n<p><code>MemPool</code> is updated in three cases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>When a new proposal/vote is received</strong>.

In this case some data in <code>MemPool</code> may become\ninvalid. In fact, it happens only when epoch changes. That can happen\nbecause stable stake distribution changes and some votes may have not enough\nstake for inclusion. It\'s done in the\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/763822c4fd906f36fa97b6b1f973d31d52342f3f/update/Pos/Update/Logic/Local.hs#L283"><code>processNewSlot</code></a>\nfunction.</li>\n<li><strong>When <code>GState</code> is updated</strong>.

For instance, we have a proposal in memory, apply block with this\nproposal and it becomes invalid (because it\'s already in block). We should\ndrop such proposals. Or we have a vote for proposal from some block, then\nrollback of this block happens and vote is no longer valid. It is\nimplemented by applying all local data to empty state, ignoring all data\nwhich is no longer valid.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Proposal and Votes Accumulation</h3>\n<p>To vote for a proposal, nodes should send their\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/04dc8e4a640a62f0d82633f3a78ab3d8540fd5e6/update/Pos/Update/Core/Types.hs#L255">votes</a>.\nProposals and votes are stored in mempool (even if proposals don\'t have enough\nvotes for inclusion into blocks, this way votes can be collected automatically)\nor gathered from the blockchain in order to figure out which proposal is\nadopted.</p>\n<h2>Interaction With the Database</h2>\n<p>In order to verify update system data, we have to get this data from the global\nstate (database). To provide such interface, a well-documented type class\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/446444070ee09857603797a90af970fff215c8c5/update/Pos/Update/Poll/Class.hs#L29"><code>MonadPollRead</code></a>\nis presented. This type class is used not only for DB interaction, but also to\ntake mempool into account when the data received from the network are processed.\nIt is important that its implementation relies on functions found in\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/04dc8e4a640a62f0d82633f3a78ab3d8540fd5e6/update/Pos/Update/DB.hs"><code>Pos.Update.DB</code></a> module.</p>\n<h2>Core Types</h2>\n<p>Core types are mentioned in the <a href="/technical/protocols/binary-protocols/">Binary Protocols</a>\ndocument. Those types reflect the concepts from the research section in a straightforward way.\nPlease refer to the <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/04dc8e4a640a62f0d82633f3a78ab3d8540fd5e6/update/Pos/Update/Core/Types.hs">core types\nmodule</a>\nfor more information.</p>\n<h2>Update Proposal Approval</h2>\n<p>A very important part of implementation of the update mechanism is the part that\nworks with genesis blocks for epochs. This logic resides in\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/6b5eda44e5942599a9781e5ad3f51eb820665b83/src/Pos/Update/Poll/Logic/Softfork.hs#L68"><code>processGenesisBlock</code></a> function.\nThe terminology related to this process is explained below.</p>\n<h3>Threshold</h3>\n<p>Suppose there is a block version <code>X</code>. And there are blocks with version <code>X</code>\ncreated in slots <code>S</code> (where <code>S</code> is a set of slots). If total relative stake of\nleaders of all slots in <code>S</code> is ≥ <code>softforkResolutionThreshold</code> (referred to as\n«threshold» in the code), then <code>X</code> becomes adopted. See the more detailed\ndescription in <a href="/cardano/update-mechanism/#soft-fork-updates">research overview</a>.</p>\n<h3>Proposal states</h3>\n<p>Update proposal can be in one of the states described below.</p>\n<h4>Undecided</h4>\n<p>It means that update proposal is contained in one of the blocks, but it doesn\'t\nhave <code>50%</code> votes for/against it (here <code>50%</code> means total stake of voters who are\nfor/against proposal relative to total stake of all stakeholders in system) and\nimplicit agreement rule hasn\'t been triggered yet.</p>\n<!-- TODO: **Important remark:** when we are talking about stake, we need to be clear about\nwhich stake distribution we are talking about. For each epoch we know stable distribution\nfor this epoch. It used in leaders selection (follow-the-satoshi) and also in many other\ncases. Stable distribution is distribution as it was \ufeff⁠⁠⁠⁠2k\ufeff⁠⁠⁠⁠ slots before the end of epoch.\nTo calculate stake of votes for proposal \ufeff⁠⁠⁠⁠p\ufeff⁠⁠⁠⁠ we use stake distribution as per epoch in\nwhich \ufeff⁠⁠⁠⁠p\ufeff⁠⁠⁠⁠ was added to blocks. I. e. distribution which was \ufeff⁠⁠⁠⁠2k\ufeff⁠⁠⁠⁠ slots before the\nend of that epoch. This ensures that nobody can transfer his funds to another address\nand vote from that address to increase total stake of voters.\n\n**Another important remark:** when we are talking about stake, it\'s also important to be\nclear whether we consider delegated stake. I. e. if Alice delegated to Bob, do we consider\nthat Alice\'s funds belong to Bob or Alice? When we use stake for votes, we consider delegated\nstake, i. e. we consider that Alice\'s funds belong to Bob. Note that here we consider\nonly heavyweight delegation. I hope it\'s covered in documentation, but I am not sure. -->\n<h4>Approved</h4>\n<p>It means that proposal has more than <code>50%</code> votes for it or it was added to block\nlong ago (according to implicit agreement rule) and it has more positive votes\nthan negative (comparison by stake of course).</p>\n<h4>Rejected</h4>\n<p>A proposal is called <strong>rejected</strong> if that proposal has more than <code>50%</code> votes\nagainst it or it was added to block long ago (according to implicit agreement\nrule) and it has more negative votes than positive (again, comparison by stake).</p>\n<h4>Confirmed</h4>\n<p>An <strong>approved</strong> proposal is called <strong>confirmed</strong> if at least <code>k</code> blocks ago\nproposal became <strong>Approved</strong>. At this point we can be sure that proposal won\'t\nbecome <strong>rejected</strong>, because rollbacks with depth more than <code>k</code> aren\'t possible.</p>\n<h4>Discarded</h4>\n<p>A <strong>rejected</strong> proposal is called <strong>discarded</strong>, if at least <code>k</code> blocks ago that\nproposal became <strong>rejected</strong>. At this point we can be sure that proposal won\'t\nbe approved, because rollbacks with depth more than <code>k</code> aren\'t possible.</p>\n<h2>Download New Version</h2>\n<p>In the\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/04dc8e4a640a62f0d82633f3a78ab3d8540fd5e6/src/Pos/Update/Download.hs"><code>Pos.Update.Download</code></a>\nmodule, the following algorithms are implemented.

But core idea of PVSS Scheme is that not just\nthe participants can verify their shares, but that anybody can verify that the\nparticipants received correct shares.

However, such a situation can be unattractive,\nbecause a majority of elected stakeholders must participate in the Coin Tossing\nprotocol for refreshing randomness (crucial attribute of the slot leader\nelection process). If there are a lot of elected stakeholders, this can put a\nstrain on the stakeholders and the network, since it might require broadcasting\nand storing a large number of commitments and shares.</p>\n<p>Delegation feature allows stakeholders called <em>issuers</em> <code>I1...In</code> to transfer their\n"committee participation" to some <em>delegates</em> <code>D1...Dm</code>. These delegates will represent\nstakeholders <code>S1...Sn</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/4bd49d6b852e778c52c60a384a47681acec02d22/src/Pos/Ssc/GodTossing.hs">Coin Tossing protocol</a>.

To do\nit, the slot-leader uses a <em>delegation-by-proxy</em> scheme: the slot leader generates <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/4378a616654ff47faf828ef51ab2f455fa53d3a3/core/Pos/Crypto/SignTag.hs#L33">a proxy\nsigning key</a>, or PSK, and the delegate will use it <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/ed6db6c8a44489e2919cd0e01582f638f4ad9b72/src/Pos/Delegation/Listeners.hs#L65">to\nsign</a>\nmessages to authenticate a block. There are two kinds of PSKs, heavyweight and\nlightweight (see below).</p>\n<p>Specifically, the stakeholder forms a special certificate specifying the delegates\nidentity via its public key.

It means that stakeholder\nhas to posses not less than <code>T</code> in order to participate in heavyweight\ndelegation. The value of this threshold is defined in the <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/42f413b65eeacb59d0b439d04073edcc5adc2656/lib/configuration.yaml#L224">configuration file</a>. Thus, the value of threshold for Mainnet is 0.03% of\nthe total stake. This value can be changed by update system.</p>\n<p>Proxy signing certificates from heavyweight delegation are stored within the blockchain.\nPlease note that issuer can post only one certificate per one epoch.</p>\n<p>Please note that heavyweight delegation has transitive relation. Thus, if <code>A</code> delegates to <code>B</code>\nand after that <code>B</code> delegates to <code>C</code> then <code>C</code>\'s delegated stake is equal to the sum <code>A + B</code>, not\njust <code>B</code>.</p>\n<h3>Expiration</h3>\n<p>Heavyweight delegation certificates expire in the beginning of every epoch if\nstakeholder does not pass threshold <code>T</code> anymore. This is made to prevent delegation\npool bloat attacks where user commits a certificate and moves all his money (above threshold)\nto another account, and then repeats the operation.</p>\n<h2>Lightweight Delegation</h2>\n<p><strong>WARNING: Currently, lightweight delegation is disabled and will be reworked in <a href="https://cardanoroadmap.com/">Shelley release</a>,\nso information below can be outdated.</strong></p>\n<p>In contrast to heavyweight delegation, lightweight delegation doesn\'t require\nthat delegate posses <code>T</code>-or-more stake. So lightweight delegation is available\nfor any node. But proxy signing certificates for lightweight delegation are not\nstored in the blockchain, so lightweight delegation certificate must be broadcasted\nto reach delegate.</p>\n<p>Later lightweight PSK can be\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/42f413b65eeacb59d0b439d04073edcc5adc2656/lib/src/Pos/Delegation/Logic/Mempool.hs#L309">verified</a>\ngiven issuer\'s public key, signature and message itself.</p>\n<p>Please note that the rule "only one certificate per epoch" doesn\'t apply to lightweight delegation.\nSince lightweight delegation certificates are not stored in the blockchain it\'s possible to issue\na lot of lightweight certificates per epoch and blockchain won\'t be bloated.</p>\n<h3>Confirmation of proxy signature delivery</h3>\n<p>The delegate should take the proxy signing key he has and make a signature of PSK using\nPSK and delegate\'s key. If the signature is correct, then it was done by the delegate\n(guaranteed by the PSK scheme).</p>\n<h2>Why Two Delegations?</h2>\n<p>You can think of heavyweight and lightweight delegations as of strong and weak delegations correspondingly.</p>\n<p>Heavyweight certificates are stored in the blockchain, so delegated stake may participate in MPC\nby being added to the stake of delegate. So delegate by many heavyweight delegations may accumulate\nenough stake to pass eligibility threshold. Moreover, heavyweight delegates can participate in voting\nfor Cardano SL updates.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, stake for lightweight delegation won\'t be counted in delegate\'s MPC-related stake. So\nlightweight delegation can be used for block generation only.</p>\n<h2>Revocation Certificate</h2>\n<p>Revocation certificate is a special certificate that issuer creates to revoke delegation.\nBoth heavyweight and lightweight delegation can be revoked, but not in the same way.</p>\n<p>The revocation certificate is the same as standard PSK where issuer and delegate are the same\n(in other words, issuer delegates to himself).</p>\n<p>To revoke lightweight delegation issuer sends revocation certificate to the network and\n<em>asks</em> to revoke delegation, but it cannot <em>enforce</em> this revocation, since lightweight PSKs\nare not the part of the blockchain. So theoretically lightweight delegate can ignore revocation\ncertificate, and in this case it will remain a delegate until its delegation certificate expires.\nBut such a situation won\'t compromise the blockchain.</p>\n<p>Revocation of heavyweight delegation is handled other way. Since proxy signing certificates\nfrom heavyweight delegation are stored within the blockchain, revocation certificate will be\ncommitted in the blockchain as well. In this case the node removes heavyweight delegation\ncertificate which was issued before revocation certificate. But there are three important notes\nabout it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the committed heavyweight delegation certificate is in the node\'s memory pool, and revocation\ncertificate was committed as well, the delegation certificate will be removed from the memory pool.\nObviously, in this case delegation certificate will never be added to the blockchain.</li>\n<li>If a user commits heavyweight delegation certificate and <em>after that</em> he loses its money, he still\ncan revoke that delegation, even if by that time he does not have enough money (i.e. amount of money\nhe has is less than threshold <code>T</code> mentioned above).</li>\n<li>Although an issuer can post only one certificate in the current epoch, he <em>can</em> revoke his heavyweight\ndelegation in the same epoch.</li>\n</ol>',

First, let\'s examine the <code>instance</code> part. This particular\nsnippet says that the data structure defined by type <code>MsgGetHeaders</code> is used as\na message payload. The name of such message is <code>"GetHeaders"</code>.</p>\n<p>In this particular case, the data structure has two fields: <code>mghFrom</code> and\n<code>mghTo</code>. Prefixes like <code>mgh</code> are used because Haskell puts symbols for record\nfields in the global namespace, so it is programmer\'s duty to avoid clashes.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that sometimes you see messages that are parametrized with a\ntype variable <code>ssc</code>. That is done for the code to be polymorphic with respect to\nthe way we carry out shared seed computation.\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/04dc8e4a640a62f0d82633f3a78ab3d8540fd5e6/src/Pos/Block/Network/Types.hs#L65-L67">Here</a> is an example of a message that sends newest headers first, minding <code>ssc</code>.</p>\n<p>The way messages are serialized can be seen in\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/04dc8e4a640a62f0d82633f3a78ab3d8540fd5e6/src/Pos/Binary/Communication.hs"><code>Pos.Binary.Communication</code></a> module.</p>\n<p>Every message type should have an instance of the <code>Message</code> typeclass.

To do\nthis, the node has to know some other node that already participates in the\nprotocol; this node is called a <em>bootstrap node</em>.</p>\n<p>After connecting to the bootstrap node, we receive a list of peers which we\'ll\nuse for network communication. Those peers are called <em>neighbors</em>. The list of\nneighbors should be maintained in such a way that these nodes are online and any\nnode from the network can receive our messages. Moreover, messages should be\ndelivered efficiently.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, Cardano SL uses the <em>Kademlia</em> DHT protocol. Even though\nKademlia provides more features, we only use it as a method of peer discovery.</p>\n<h2>Overview of Kademlia Protocol</h2>\n<p><em>See also: the <a href="/technical#p2p-network">P2P Network section</a> of the technical\noverview.</em></p>\n<p>In Kademlia, every node is associated with a 32-byte ID (see <a href="#id-structure">ID\nstructure</a> for more details). These IDs are used to identify\nnodes without having to refer to their network addresses. The keys used to\nstore values in Kademlia are also 32-byte identifiers.</p>\n<p>Kademlia uses the XOR metric to define the distance between nodes. Key-value\npairs are stored in nodes with IDs that are “close” to the keys. This distance\nis also used to efficiently locate a node with the given ID.</p>\n<p>At start, a bootstrap node should be provided to Kademlia in order to join the\nnetwork. The address of this node can be hardcoded in the implementation or\nchosen by the user. Later, the node will attempt to find more peers by querying\nits neighbors (from the initial list of peers sent by the bootstrap node). A\nnode sends messages to its peers, which resend messages to their peers close to\nthe needed ID/key. The list of known peers is preserved between launches.</p>\n<p>Here and later, by <em>address</em> we mean tuple <code>(Host, Port, ID)</code>, while <em>network\naddress</em> denotes just the pair <code>(Host, Port)</code>.</p>\n<p>Kademlia uses the UDP protocol for transmitting messages.</p>\n<p>To learn more about how Kademlia is implemented, please refer to the paper\n<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf">Kademlia: a Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR\nMetric</a>.</p>\n<h2>Messages Used in Kademlia</h2>\n<p>Every message is represented as a binary string with the maximum length of <a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/7120bb4d28e708acd52dfd61d3dca7914fac7d7f/src/Network/Kademlia/Config.hs#L61">1200\nbytes</a>\n(so that it wouldn\'t exceed IPv6 datagram size).

First, launch a hundred nodes with\nnode IDs close to target node ID. These nodes would fill the node\'s lowest\n<code>k</code>-buckets (which are expected to be empty, at a first sight), then perform a\nDDoS attack on nodes from target\'s <code>k</code>-buckets (it\'s possible to determine those\nnodes if network\'s topology haven\'t changed much since the node was started).\nAfter a successful DDoS attack, the node\'s remaining neighbors would be\nadversary agents.</p>\n<p>Please note that Kademlia’s structure implies that launching nodes close to the\ntarget is not enough to eclipse it. Node lists are stored by node in <code>k</code>-buckets\n(the i-th bucket contains no more than <code>k</code> nodes with relative distance\n<code>2^i-1 &#x3C; d &#x3C; 2^i</code>), and new nodes are added to corresponding buckets only if\nthese buckets are not already full. Kademlia prefers nodes that have been in\nlists for a long time and were recently seen alive. Without getting some nodes\ndown, it\'s impossible to eclipse a node.</p>\n<p>This attack is tricky and unlikely to happen in practice. The\n<a href="#addressing">Addressing</a> modification makes it even harder.</p>\n<p>A <strong>100500 attack</strong> is an attack that launches significantly more nodes than the\namount of nodes in the current P2P network, either in order to eclipse some\nnodes or to deny service by flooding the network. The attack wouldn\'t cause any\nproblems for old nodes (not counting possible network overhead), because old\nnodes preserve their routes. But when a new node joins the network, it would get\neclipsed (isolated in an adversarial subnet), because old honest nodes won\'t add\nit to their buckets (as these buckets are already filled by other nodes), and\nthe new node would be known to adversaries only.</p>\n<p>Defending against 100500 attacks remains an open problem. For now, we\'re going\nto make them practically infeasible with a sophisticated ban system / adversary\ndetection.</p>\n<h3>Addressing</h3>\n<p>We use so-called <code>HashId</code>s as node IDs. Since it <a href="#id-structure">contains</a> a\nhash, assigning yourself an arbitrary ID is impossible, and this means that a\n100500 attack is the only way to perform an eclipse attack.</p>\n<h4>Implementation Notes</h4>\n<p><code>HashId</code> is a binary string with a fixed length (32 bytes) formed like this:</p>\n<pre><code>+---------------+------------+\n|    Hashing    |    Nonce   |\n+---------------+------------+\n\n|   18 bytes    |  14 bytes  |\n</code></pre>\n<p>where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Nonce</code> is just random 14 bytes (from the system source of entropy),</li>\n<li><code>Hashing</code> is hashing data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hashing data is generated based on <code>DerivingKey</code> and <code>Salt</code>, where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>DerivingKey</code> is generated by PBKDF2 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">Password Based Key Derivation\nFunction 2</a>).</li>\n<li><code>Salt</code> is a SHA-512 digest from <code>Nonce</code> mentioned above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For <code>DerivingKey</code> generation we use these arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>prfPassword</code> - PRF (pseudorandom function) for PBKDF2 using HMAC\n(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code">Hash-based Message Authentication\nCode</a>)\nwith SHA-256 algorithm.</li>\n<li><code>parameters</code> - PBKDF2 parameters: 500 iterations, for 32 bytes as a result\noutput.</li>\n<li><code>Nonce</code> mentioned above - as <code>password</code>.</li>\n<li><code>Salt</code> mentioned above - as <code>salt</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Routing Data Anti-forging</h3>\n<p>In Kademlia, a node requests a list of peers from its neighbors and accepts the\nfirst message it receives. An adversary may forge those replies, providing\naddresses of adversary nodes as closest nodes to given ID. To overcome this\nissue, we make nodes wait for some period to gather as many replies as possible,\nand after that, the replies get merged and the node selects <code>k</code> closest nodes from\nthe resulting set. This way, an adversary would have to eclipse a node in order\nto forge the list of peers it receives.</p>\n<h4>Implementation Notes</h4>\n<p>To implement this idea, we just add <code>k</code> neighbors nodes closest to the\ndestination at the beginning of each\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/7120bb4d28e708acd52dfd61d3dca7914fac7d7f/src/Network/Kademlia/Implementation.hs#L48">lookup</a>\n(<code>lookup</code> is a function used by <code>FIND_NODE</code> or <code>FIND_VALUE</code> to find <code>k</code> nodes\nclosest to the given ID) to the\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/7120bb4d28e708acd52dfd61d3dca7914fac7d7f/src/Network/Kademlia/Implementation.hs#L243">pending</a>\nset. When we receive a <code>RETURN_NODES</code> message, we update\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/7120bb4d28e708acd52dfd61d3dca7914fac7d7f/src/Network/Kademlia/Implementation.hs#L242">known</a>\nlist to make it contain <code>k</code> nodes currently known that are closest to the\ndestination ID. This loop ends when no <em>pending</em> nodes are left. We do not\nintroduce any specific period to collect neighbors replies. If any neighbors do\nnot send us <code>RETURN_NODES</code> reply, we receive <code>Timeout</code> signal and this neighbor\nis handled by\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/7120bb4d28e708acd52dfd61d3dca7914fac7d7f/src/Network/Kademlia/Implementation.hs#L286"><code>waitForReply</code></a> function.</p>\n<p>See also\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/7120bb4d28e708acd52dfd61d3dca7914fac7d7f/src/Network/Kademlia/Implementation.hs#L371"><code>continueLookup</code></a> function.\nIt is the place where <em>pending</em> and <em>known</em> fields are updated, so this is where\nthe core logic of this enhancement is located.</p>\n<h3>Routing Tables Sharing</h3>\n<p>When a node has just joined the network, it requests a list of neighbors (set of\nnodes closest to it). We have modified Kademlia to include some extra nodes into\nthis list; specifically, now we pick some random nodes along with neighbors and\nreturn them. This gives the node additional knowledge to recover in case it\'s\nsurrounded with adversary nodes.</p>\n<h4>Implementation Notes</h4>\n<p>There is the function\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/7120bb4d28e708acd52dfd61d3dca7914fac7d7f/src/Network/Kademlia/Tree.hs#L195"><code>findClosest</code></a>\nin our Kademlia implementation which finds <code>k</code> nodes closest to the given ID.\nThe function\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/7120bb4d28e708acd52dfd61d3dca7914fac7d7f/src/Network/Kademlia/Tree.hs#L180"><code>pickupRandom</code></a>\nwas added.

This way, <code>RETURN_NODES</code> message\nincludes the results of <code>findClosest</code> and <code>pickupRandom</code> calls.</p>\n<h3>Banning Nodes</h3>\n<p>We introduce a feature to ban nodes to Kademlia. We will use this to ban nodes\nwhen we detect them to act maliciously.</p>\n<h4>Implementation Notes</h4>\n<p>There are three possible states for a node:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>NoBan</code>,</li>\n<li><code>BanTill</code>,</li>\n<li><code>BanForever</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please see\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/7120bb4d28e708acd52dfd61d3dca7914fac7d7f/src/Network/Kademlia/Instance.hs#L66"><code>BanState</code></a> type.

It uses\nsome informal type theory, which hopefully is understandable to everyone reading\nthis document.</p>\n<p>Plutus comes with a handful of built-in types (ints, floats, bytestrings), and a\nsingle built-in type operator (functions). Other types are defined by the\nauthors of programs. We\'ll discuss each of these in turn.</p>\n<h2>Ints, Floats, and Byte Strings</h2>\n<p><code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>ByteString</code> are primitive types, with constructor forms\ngiven by various constants specified by the following grammar.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;int> ::= "-"? &#x3C;digit>+\n&#x3C;float> ::= "-"? &#x3C;digit>+ &#x3C;fractExponent>\n&#x3C;digit> = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"\n&#x3C;fractExponent> ::= &#x3C;fraction> &#x3C;exponent>? | &#x3C;exponent>\n&#x3C;fraction> ::= "." &#x3C;digit>+\n&#x3C;exponent> ::= ("e" | "E") ("-" | "+") &#x3C;digit>+\n\n&#x3C;bytestring> ::= "#" &#x3C;byte>*\n&#x3C;byte> ::= &#x3C;nybble> &#x3C;nybble>\n&#x3C;nybble> ::= &#x3C;digit>\n           | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"\n           | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F"\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are no true eliminator forms for these types, but there are a number of\nbuilt-in operations which can be applied to these types. We write the signatures\nof built-ins as follows: <code>f : (A,B) ⇀ C</code> indicates that a built-in name <code>f</code> can\nbe applied to an <code>A</code> and a <code>B</code> to produce a <code>C</code>. The built-ins for these\nprimitive types are as follows, with implementations in terms of Haskell\nfunctions:</p>\n<pre><code>addInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int\n  implemented as `(+) :: Int -> Int -> Int`\n\nsubtractInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int\n  implemented as `(-) :: Int -> Int -> Int`\n\nmultiplyInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int\n  implemented as `(*) :: Int -> Int -> Int`\n\ndivideInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int\n  implemented as `div :: Int -> Int -> Int`\n\nremainderInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Int\n  implemented as `(%) :: Int -> Int -> Int`\n\nlessThanInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Bool\n  implemented as `(&#x3C;) :: Int -> Int -> Bool`\n\nequalsInt : (Int,Int) ⇀ Bool\n  implemented as `(==) :: Int -> Int -> Bool`\n\nintToFloat : (Int) ⇀ Float\n  implemented as `fromInteger . toInteger :: Int -> Float`\n\nintToByteString : (Int) ⇀ ByteString\n  implemented as `encode :: Int -> ByteString`\n\naddFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Float\n  implemented as `(+) :: Float -> Float -> Float`\n\nsubtractFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Float\n  implemented as `(-) :: Float -> Float -> Float`\n\nmultiplyFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Float\n  implemented as `(*) :: Float -> Float -> Float`\n\ndivideFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Float\n  implemented as `(/) :: Float -> Float -> Float`\n\nlessThanFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Bool\n  implemented as `(&#x3C;) :: Float -> Float -> Bool`\n\nequalsFloat : (Float,Float) ⇀ Bool\n  implemented as `(==) :: Float -> Float -> Bool`\n\nceiling : (Float) ⇀ Float\n  implemented as `ceiling:: Float -> Float`\n\nfloor : (Float) ⇀ Float\n  implemented as `floor :: Float -> Float`\n\nround : (Float) ⇀ Float\n  implemented as `round :: Float -> Float`\n\nconcatenate : (ByteString,ByteString) ⇀ ByteString\n  implemented via `concat :: [ByteString] -> ByteString`\n\ndrop : (Int,ByteString) ⇀ ByteString\n  implemented via `drop :: Integer -> ByteString -> ByteString`\n\ntake : (Int,ByteString) ⇀ ByteString\n  implemented via `take :: Integer -> ByteString -> ByteString`\n\nsha2_256 : (ByteString) ⇀ ByteString\n  implemented via `hash : [Char8] -> Digest SHA256`\n\nsha3_256 : (ByteString) ⇀ ByteString\n  implemented via `hash : [Char8] -> Digest SHA3_256`\n\nequalsByteString : (ByteString,ByteString) ⇀ Bool\n  implemented as `(==) :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Bool`\n</code></pre>\n<p>The use of these built-in functions is by prefixing the name with <code>!</code> and fully\napplying them to arguments. E.g., adding 2 and 3 would be <code>!addInt 2 3</code>.</p>\n<h2>Function Types</h2>\n<p>Given any <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> types, there is a function type <code>A -> B</code>. To get a term of\nthis type, we can use the lambda introduction form as follows: if <code>M</code> has type\n<code>B</code> and has a free variable <code>x</code> that has type <code>A</code>, then <code>\\x -> M</code> has type\n<code>A -> B</code>. We can use a term with a function type as follows: if <code>M</code> has type\n<code>A -> B</code> and <code>N</code> has type <code>A</code>, then <code>M N</code> has type <code>B</code>. The computation for\nfunctions is standard beta reduction: <code>(\\x -> M) N</code> reduces to <code>[N/x]M</code>, i.e. to\n<code>M</code> with <code>N</code> substituted for <code>x</code>. Computation in Plutus is performed eagerly, so\n<code>N</code> is evaluated before substitution is performed.</p>\n<h2>User Declared Types</h2>\n<p>When a user declares a new data type, for example</p>\n<pre><code>data Foo a = { Bar | Baz a }\n</code></pre>\n<p>this defines a new type constructor, in this case <code>Foo</code>, which has the following\ninference rule associated with it: given any type <code>A</code>, <code>Foo A</code> is also a type.</p>\n<p>It also comes with inference rules for the constructors, as follows: <code>Bar</code> has\ntype <code>Foo A</code>, for any choice of <code>A</code>; and if <code>M</code> has type <code>A</code>, then <code>Baz M</code> has\ntype <code>Foo A</code>.</p>\n<p>The eliminator form for user declared types is the case construct, which is used\nfor all such types. Case analysis is the same as in Haskell, for example, we\ncould write</p>\n<pre><code>case foo of { Bar -> 0 | Baz x -> x }\n</code></pre>\n<p>to analyze an element of type <code>Foo Int</code>, computing an <code>Int</code>. There is a minor\ndifference from Haskell, however: we can analyze multiple terms at the same\ntime, by separating them (and their corresponding patterns) with <code>|</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>case foo0 | foo1 of { Bar | Bar -> 0 ; Baz x | Baz y -> !addInt x y }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Case analysis is not required to be total, that is to say, there may be missing\npatterns. Any failed match causes the entire program to fail to run, and will\ncause a transaction to be considered invalid.</p>\n<p><code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>ByteString</code> literals can be patterns as well; for example,\nwe can define the factorial function using case in this way:</p>\n<pre><code>facInt : Int -> Int {\n  facInt n = case n of {\n    0 -> 1 ;\n    _ -> !multiplyInt n (!subtractInt n 1)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>',frontmatter:{path:"/en/technical/plutus/types/",doc_title:"Types",author:null,date:"2017-01-01",language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"technical-plutus"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/technical/plutus/2017-01-03-examples.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"Plutus Examples Here we'll take a look at some of the common examples of programs to give you a\nbetter feel of how the Plutus language works…",html:"<!-- Reviewed at 25dc86c0fd9741b2f1c59d3a594c48844bbc73f5 -->\n<h1>Plutus Examples</h1>\n<p>Here we'll take a look at some of the common examples of programs to give you a\nbetter feel of how the Plutus language works. We'll implement Peano numerals,\ncons lists, and binary trees, as well as some common functions relating them.</p>\n<p>To start with, let's define Peano numerals:</p>\n<pre><code>data Nat = { Zero | Suc Nat }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The naturals support a variety of functions, of course, such as addition,\nmultiplication, factorial, and Fibonacci, which are typical examples of\nprograms.</p>\n<pre><code>add : Nat -> Nat -> Nat {\n  add Zero n = n ;\n  add (Suc m) n = Suc (add m n)\n}\n\nmul : Nat -> Nat -> Nat {\n  mul Zero _ = Zero ;\n  mul (Suc m) n = add (mul m n) n\n}\n\nfac : Nat -> Nat {\n  fac Zero = Suc Zero ;\n  fac (Suc n) = mul (Suc n) (fac n)\n}\n\nfib : Nat -> Nat {\n  fib Zero = Suc Zero ;\n  fib (Suc Zero) = Suc Zero ;\n  fib (Suc (Suc n)) = add (fib n) (fib (Suc n))\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Cons lists are also a familiar type:</p>\n<pre><code>data List a = { Nil | Cons a (List a) }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This demonstrates the use of parametric types, where <code>List a</code> has a type\nparameter <code>a</code> for the type of elements. So, for example, <code>List Nat</code> is the type\nof lists of Peano numerals.</p>\n<p>Lists support a variety of functions, such as <code>length</code>, <code>append</code>, and <code>map</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>length : forall a. List a -> Nat {\n  length Nil = Zero ;\n  length (Cons _ xs) = Suc (length xs)\n}\n\nappend : forall a. List a -> List a -> List a {\n  append Nil ys = ys ;\n  append (Cons x xs) ys = Cons x (append xs ys)\n}\n\nmap : forall a b. (a -> b) -> List a -> List b {\n  map _ Nil = Nil ;\n  map f (Cons x xs) = Cons (f x) (map f xs)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we can see the use of polymorphism principle in Plutus. These functions\nwork for any list, regardless of the element type, so we can abstract over the\nelement type by using <code>forall</code>. For instance, the type of <code>length</code> says that for\nany choice of <code>a</code>, we have a function of type <code>List a -> Nat</code>.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that in Plutus, this polymorphism exists only for the\ndeclaration of values. Any time you use a polymorphically declared value, the\nchoice of the type variable must be fixed at the use site. You can't treat these\ndeclarations as giving polymorphic values in general, as in System-F. Rather, a\npolymorphic type in a declaration is an abbreviation for an infinite family of\nidentical definitions that differ only in the choice of that type variable. For\nexample, we could define multiple <code>length</code> functions like so:</p>\n<pre><code>lengthNat : List Nat -> Nat {\n  lengthNat Nil = Zero ;\n  lengthNat (Cons _ xs) = Suc (lengthNat xs)\n}\n\nlengthBool : List Bool -> Nat {\n  lengtBool Nil = Zero ;\n  lengthBool (Cons _ xs) = Suc (lengthBool xs)\n}\n\nlengthListNat : List (List Nat) -> Nat {\n  lengthListNat Nil = Zero ;\n  lengthListNat (Cons _ xs) = Suc (lengthListNat xs)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And they're all identical except the name and the choice for <code>a</code>. This is of\ncourse redundant, so we can use the polymorphic declaration given above. But\nthis declaration does not give us a value <code>length</code> with the type\n<code>forall a. List a -> Nat</code>. Instead, it gives us that entire infinite family of\ndeclarations, but with a convenient abbreviation syntax. This is why the use of\nsuch polymorphic declarations requires the choice of the type variables to be\nfixed at the use site.</p>\n<p>Another common type is the type of binary trees with data in the branches:</p>\n<pre><code>data Tree a = { Leaf | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a) }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Such trees support functions such as <code>count</code>, <code>traversal</code>, and <code>reverse</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>count : forall a. Tree a -> Nat {\n  count Leaf = Zero ;\n  count (Branch _ l r) = Suc (add (count l) (count r))\n}\n\ntraversal : forall a. Tree a -> List a {\n  traversal Leaf = Nil ;\n  traversal (Branch x l r) = Cons x (append (traversal l) (traversal r))\n}\n\nreverse : forall a. Tree a -> Tree a {\n  reverse Leaf = Leaf ;\n  reverse (Branch x l r) = Branch x (reverse r) (reverse l)\n}\n</code></pre>",frontmatter:{path:"/en/technical/plutus/examples/",doc_title:"Examples",author:null,date:"2017-01-01",language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"technical-plutus"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/technical/2017-01-01-cli-options.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"Cardano SL CLI Options This guide describes all executable files that are used in Cardano SL and all corresponding CLI-options/parameters…",html:"<!-- THIS IS AUTOGENERATED CHAPTER.

It is in principle independent of the application protocol (indeed the\nreference implementation is used in multiple different applications with\ndifferent application level protocols).</p>\n<p>The point of the transport layer is that it provides multiple lightweight\nlogical connections multiplexed on a single TCP connection. Each lightweight\nconnection is unidirectional and provides reliable ordered message transport\n(i.e. it provides framing on top of TCP).</p>\n<p>Properties of the transport protocol:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single TCP connection</strong>. Only a single TCP connection at a time is used\nbetween any pair of peers. These connections are potentially long-lived.\nOnce a connection with a peer is established, it is used for\nsending/receiving messages until the TCP connection is <em>explicitly</em> closed\nor some unrecoverable error occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Properties of the implementation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reporting of network failures</strong>. Network failures are not hidden from the\napplication layer. If a TCP connection is dropped unexpectedly, the\ntransport layer should notify the application layer. In Cardano SL, the\npolicy is to try to reconnect and only declare a peer unreachable if\nreconnecting also fails.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Typical use of the transport involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Listening for new TCP connections from peers.</li>\n<li>Establishing a TCP connection to other peer(s).</li>\n<li>Creating lightweight connections on an established TCP connection.</li>\n<li>Sending message(s) to peer(s) (on one or more lightweight connections).</li>\n<li>Receiving message(s) from peer(s) (on one or more lightweight connections).</li>\n<li>Closing lightweight connections.</li>\n<li>Closing TCP connections.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In Cardano SL, multiple lightweight connections are used to support the\napplication level messaging protocol. Multiple application level messages can be\nsent concurrently, and multiple conversations can be in progress at once. Most\napplication messages are sent on a newly created lightweight connection, and, if\nneeded, larger application level message are broken into multiple transport\nlevel messages for transport. Other application level messages are sent as part\nof a conversation which is put together from a pair of unidirectional\nlightweight connections.</p>\n<h2>Terminology</h2>\n<p>Basic transport concepts are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transport</li>\n<li>EndPoint</li>\n<li>Connection</li>\n<li>Event</li>\n<li>Errors</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transport</strong> refers to the whole layer and protocol described in this document.\nAn instance of the transport refers to the configuration and state of a running\nimplementation of the transport, which in particular includes a TCP listening\nsocket, bound to a particular port on a local network interface, for example\n<code>192.168.0.1:3010</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>EndPoint</strong> refers to a logical endpoint within a transport instance. This\nmeans it has an address and that connections are between endpoints. In practice\nit is just a thin abstraction over the TCP/IP notion of an endpoint, addressed\nvia a hostname and port.</p>\n<p>Endpoint addresses are binary strings with the structure <code>HOST:PORT:LOCAL_ID</code>,\nfor example, <code>192.168.0.1:3010:0</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that while a transport instance listens on a single port, in principle\nthere can be multiple addressable endpoints within a single transport instance,\nand this is what the <code>LOCAL_ID</code> refers to. Cardano SL, however, does not\ncurrently make use of this feature, so it always uses <code>LOCAL_ID</code> 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavyweight connection</strong> refers to a TCP connection between two endpoints. Two\nconnected endpoints use one and <em>only one</em> TCP-connection at once.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong> (or more explicitly a <em>lightweight connection</em>) is a\nunidirectional connection between endpoints. All lightweight connections between\nendpoints are multiplexed on a single heavyweight connection (i.e. a single TCP\nconnection).</p>\n<p>The lightweight connections are a logical concept layered on top of TCP. Every\nconnection has an integer ID. It is in principle possible to have thousands of\nlightweight connections multiplexed on a single heavyweight TCP connection.</p>\n<p>The typical style of operation is that the application layer wishes to establish\na lightweight connection to an endpoint, and if no heavyweight connection yet\nexists, then one is created. Similarly, when the last lightweight connection is\nclosed, real TCP connection is shut down cleanly.</p>\n<p>Lightweight connections are unidirectional: messages on a lightweight connection\nflow in one direction only. However, lightweight connections can be established\nin either direction. The same heavyweight connection is used for lightweight\nconnections in either direction between peers; it does not matter which peer\nfirst established the heavyweight connection.</p>\n<p>A bidirectional conversation can be established by making use of a pair of\nunidirectional lightweight connections. Cardano SL follows this pattern. Refer\nto the <code>time-warp-nt</code> documentation for details. But note that this transport\nlayer has no special concept of a bidirectional conversation, there are only\ncollections of unidirectional connections.</p>\n<h2>Network Byte Order</h2>\n<p>In the following descriptions of control messages, all integers are encoded in\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Networking">network byte order</a>.</p>\n<p>Thus <code>Int32</code> used below in message definitions refers to a 32-bit <em>signed</em>\ninteger value in network byte order.</p>\n<h2>Setting Up a Transport Instance</h2>\n<p>Each transport instance must set up a TCP listening socket. The local interface\nand port number to use are determined by the application using the transport.</p>\n<p>The implementation should be ready to accept new TCP connections at any time\n(perhaps limited by a resource policy), and then perform the initial steps for a\nnew heavyweight connection described below.</p>\n<h2>Establishing Heavyweight Connections (initiating)</h2>\n<p>Assume that a heavyweight connection is to be established between endpoints\nlabelled A and B, with endpoint A initiating the connection. Both endpoints have\nendpoint address, which, as previously described, are of the form\n<code>HOST:PORT:LOCAL_ID</code>.</p>\n<p>Establishing a heavyweight connection from A to B proceeds as follows. First A\nmust record in its local state that it is initializing a heavyweight connection\nto B. This is needed in case of crossed connection requests (see below). A TCP\nconnection is opened by endpoint A to the <code>HOST</code> and <code>PORT</code> of endpoint B.</p>\n<p>Endpoint A sends a <strong>connection request</strong> message with the following structure:</p>\n<pre><code>+-----------+-------------+--------------------+\n|   B-LID   |   A-EIDlen  |       A-EID        |\n+-----------+-------------+--------------------+\n|   Int32   |   Int32     |       bytes        |\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>B-LID</code> - <code>B</code>\'s endpoint local ID;</li>\n<li><code>A-EIDlen</code> - length of <code>A</code>\'s endpoint address;</li>\n<li><code>A-EID</code> - <code>A</code>\'s endpoint address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus A sends the local endpoint ID that it wishes to connect to, and its own\naddress to identify the initiating node. The address that A sends should be its\ncanonical public address. The host part may be an IP address or DNS name. It is\nused to avoid establishing multiple TCP connections between endpoints. Within\nthe Cardano SL protocol, the local endpoint ID is always 0.</p>\n<p>Endpoint A then expects a <strong>connection request response</strong> message which is a\nsingle <code>Int32</code> encoding one of the following responses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ConnectionRequestAccepted</code> (0)</li>\n<li><code>ConnectionRequestInvalid</code> (1)</li>\n<li><code>ConnectionRequestCrossed</code> (2)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the typical <code>ConnectionRequestAccepted</code> case, endpoint A must record in its\nlocal state that it now has an established (i.e. no longer initializing)\nheavyweight to B. It may then proceed to the main part of the protocol described\nbelow.</p>\n<p>A <code>ConnectionRequestInvalid</code> response occurs when the endpoint identified by the\nlocal endpoint ID does not exist. For example, it happens if A sends to B that\nit wishes to connect to local endpoint ID 1, when only ID 0 exists. In this case\nboth endpoints must close the TCP connection.</p>\n<p>A <code>ConnectionRequestCrossed</code> response occurs when endpoint B determined that a\nTCP connection already exists between A and B, or connections between A and B,\nand B and A were being established concurrently. In this case both endpoints\nmust close the TCP connection.</p>\n<h2>Establishing Heavyweight Connections (Receiving)</h2>\n<p>Assume, as before, that a heavyweight connection is to be established between\nendpoints labelled A and B, with endpoint A initiating the connection. We now\nconsider this from the point of view of endpoint B.</p>\n<p>Both endpoints have endpoint address of the form <code>HOST:PORT:LOCAL_ID</code>. To be\nconcrete, assume that B has only one endpoint, with <code>LOCAL_ID</code> of 0.</p>\n<p>The transport instance for B has a listening socket open on the host and port\ncorresponding to the endpoint IDs. It accepts a new TCP connection from some\npeer. It now expects to receive on that TCP connection a <strong>connection request</strong>\nmessage (in the format described above).</p>\n<p>Transport instance B must now respond with a <strong>connection request response</strong>\nmessage (in the format described above), based on the following rules.</p>\n<p>If the connection request asks for a local endpoint ID that does not exist (i.e.\nanything other than 0 in our example), it must respond with\n<code>ConnectionRequestInvalid</code> and close the TCP connection.</p>\n<p>The rules for <code>ConnectionRequestCrossed</code> are described below in more detail.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, when the endpoint ID is valid and there is no existing TCP\nconnection, it should reply with <code>ConnectionRequestAccepted</code> and record in its\nlocal state that it now has an established heavyweight with A. It may then\nproceed to the main part of the protocol.</p>\n<h2>Crossed Connection Request</h2>\n<p>As mentioned previously, the protocol tries to ensure that only one TCP\nconnection is used between any two endpoints at once. The typical case is that\nan endpoint can simply determine if it has an existing heavyweight connection to\na peer because it either initiated it or received it and it knows if any\nexisting TCP connection is still open. The hard case arises when two endpoints\ninitiate establishing heavyweight connections to each other <em>at the same time</em>\n(in the usual distributed systems sense of "same time").</p>\n<p>Each endpoint will have recorded in its local state that it is in the process of\ninitiating a heavyweight connection to the other endpoint. Each endpoint will\nsend the connection request message as usual. When each endpoint accepts an\nincoming TCP connection, it checks the peer endpoint ID from the connection\nrequest message.</p>\n<p>The additional rule is that it must lookup in its local state to see if a\nconnection to the peer endpoint was either 1. already <em>being</em> established\noutbound or 2. already fully established. In the first case then we are in the\ncrossed connection situation. The second case can also occur legitimately (i.e.\nnot a protocol violation) when one peer has discovered that the existing TCP\nconnection has failed (i.e. its end is closed) and is trying to establish a new\nTCP connection, while the other peer has not yet discovered that the existing\nTCP connection is dead.</p>\n<h3>Crossed Connection Situation</h3>\n<p>In the crossed connection situation, thus far this is completely symmetric\nbetween endpoints, but we must break the symmetry to resolve which of the two\nTCP connections to use, and which to close. The solution the protocol uses to\nbreak the symmetry is that the endpoint addresses can be ordered\n(lexicographically in their binary string form). Thus the rule each node must\nuse to decide whether to accept or reject the incoming connection request is:\nreply with <code>ConnectionRequestAccepted</code> if the peer\'s endpoint ID is less than\nthe local endpoint id, and otherwise reply with <code>ConnectionRequestCrossed</code> and\nclose the TCP connection.</p>\n<h3>Connection Dead / Re-establish Situation</h3>\n<p>In the second case, where the endpoint handling the incoming TCP connection has\ndetermined that an established connection already exists between the two\nendpoints, the protocol is as follows. A <code>ConnectionRequestCrossed</code> reply is\nsent and the TCP connection is closed. Additionally, the endpoint tries to\nvalidate the liveness of the existing connection, with the purpose of either\nvalidating that it is live or determining that it is not in order to close the\ndead connection (which will then allow opening a new one).</p>\n<p>To validate the liveness, the endpoint sends a <strong>ProbeSocket</strong> message. If a\n<strong>ProbeSocketAck</strong> message is not received within an implementation-defined time\nperiod then the endpoint should close the TCP connection and update its local\nstate accordingly to enable a new connection to be established by either\nendpoint.</p>\n<p>An endpoint that receives a ProbeSocket message should reply with a\nProbeSocketAck.</p>\n<p>The encoding for these messages is simple:</p>\n<pre><code>+-------------+\n| ProbeSocket |\n+-------------+\n|    Int32    |\n\n+----------------+\n| ProbeSocketAck |\n+----------------+\n|     Int32      |\n</code></pre>\n<p>where the value for the control message headers are 4 and 5 respectively.</p>\n<h2>Main Protocol</h2>\n<p>Once a heavyweight connection has been established between two endpoints then\nthe main part of the protocol begins.</p>\n<p>The main protocol between two endpoints consists of sending/receiving a series\nof messages: control messages and data messages. Each has a header to identify\nthe message and a body appropriate to the message type. The messages for the\nmain protocol are control messages to create and close lightweight connections,\nand data messages for sending data on a lightweight connection.</p>\n<p>Lightweight connections are unidirectional. There are independent sets of\nlightweight connections in each direction of the TCP connection. The lightweight\nconnections in each direction are managed by the <em>sending</em> side. The receiving\nside has no direct control over the allocation of lightweight connections.</p>\n<p>Lightweight connections are identified by a Lightweight connection ID, which is\na 32-bit signed integer. Lightweight connection IDs must be greater than 1024.\nLightweight connection ID numbers should be used sequentially.</p>\n<p>The control messages to create or close a lightweight connection simply identify\nthe lightweight connection ID that they act on. Similarly, data messages\nidentify the ID of the lightweight connection that the data is being sent on.</p>\n<p>Messages for different connection ID can be interleaved arbitrarily (enabling\nthe multiplexing of the different lightweight connections). The only constraints\nare the obvious ones: for any connection ID the sequence of messages must be a\ncreate connection message, any number of data messages and finally a close\nconnection message.</p>\n<p>The format of these messages is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>+-----------+-----------+\n| CreateCon |   LWCId   |\n+-----------+-----------+\n|   Int32   |   Int32   |\n\n+-----------+-----------+\n|  CloseCon |   LWCId   |\n+-----------+-----------+\n|   Int32   |   Int32   |\n\n+-----------+-----------+-------------------+\n|   LWCId   |    Len    |       Data        |\n+-----------+-----------+-------------------+\n|   Int32   |   Int32   |     Len-bytes     |\n</code></pre>\n<p>where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CreateCon control header is 0;</li>\n<li>CloseCon control header is 1;</li>\n<li>LWCId is the lightweight connection id, which is >= 1024.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The header Int32 is aliased between the control message headers and the\nlightweight connection IDs of the data messages, which is why connection ids\nmust be 1024 or greater.</p>\n<p>The data messages consist of the lightweight connection ID and a length-prefixed\nframe of data. Implementations of this protocol may wish to impose a maximum\nsize on these data frames, e.g. to ensure reasonable multiplexing between\nconnections or for resource considerations.</p>\n<p>Note that there need be no direct correspondence between these message\nboundaries and reads/writes on the TCP socket or packets. It may make sense for\nperformance or network efficiency to arrange for a connection open, small data\nmessage and connection close to be sent in a single write.</p>\n<h2>Closing Heavyweight Connections</h2>\n<p>Cleanly closing the heavyweight connection is not trivial. This is because the\nheavyweight connection should only be closed once lightweight connections in\nboth directions are closed. Given that the allocation of lightweight connections\nis controlled independently by each endpoint then some synchronization is\nrequired for both endpoints to agree that there are no more lightweight\nconnections in either direction.</p>\n<p>When one endpoint determines that it has no more outgoing lightweight\nconnections, and the set of incoming connections it knows of is empty, then it\nmay initiate the protocol to close the heavyweight connection. It does so by\nsending a <strong>CloseSocket</strong> message. The message carries the maximum incoming\nlightweight connection ID seen by the endpoint: i.e. the highest connection ID\nthat has been allocated by the remote endpoint that has so far been seen by the\nlocal endpoint. The local endpoint now updates the state it uses to track the\nremote endpoint to note that it is now in the process of closing. If the local\nendpoint now receives a create connection message from the remote endpoint,\nwhile it has the remote endpoint marked as being in the process of closing then\nit resets the state back to the normal connection established state. This\nhappens if the remote endpoint opened a new lightweight connection before it\nreceived the close socket message, and so the attempt to close the socket should\nbe abandoned.</p>\n<p>When an endpoint receives a <strong>CloseSocket</strong> message it checks its local state to\ncheck the number of outbound lightweight connections and the maximum lightweight\nconnection ID it has used for outgoing connections. If there are still outbound\nconnections then the close socket message is ignored. Additionally, if the\nmaximum outbound lightweight connection ID used thus far by the local node is\nhigher than the one received in the close socket message then the close socket\nmessage is ignored. This case can happen even if the number of outbound\nconnections is currently zero, if an outbound connection was created and then\nclosed prior to the close socket message arriving. In both cases what has\nhappened is that the heavyweight connection has become active again while one\nside was trying to close it due to inactivity, and so it is appropriate to\nabandon the attempt to close it.</p>\n<p>If on the other hand there are no outbound connections and the last new\nconnection ID seen by the remote endpoint is the same as that locally, then both\nsides agree and the TCP connection should be closed.</p>\n<p>The message structure is:</p>\n<pre><code>+-------------+-----------+\n| CloseSocket |   LWCId   |\n+-------------+-----------|\n|    Int32    |   Int32   |\n</code></pre>\n<p>where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CloseSocket</code> - close connection control message, value <code>2</code>;</li>\n<li><code>LWCId</code> - maximum lightweight connection ID used thus far.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Flow Control and Back-pressure</h2>\n<p>Lightweight connections do not provide any flow control over and above what is\nprovided by TCP. The protocol does not provide any facility to reject incoming\nlightweight connections. Any such facility must be layered on top, in the\napplication layer or another intermediate layer.</p>\n<p>Implementations should consider the problem of back-pressure and head of line\nblocking. Head of line blocking is a problem common to many protocols layered on\ntop of TCP, such as HTTP 1.x where one large response can "block" other smaller\nresponses for other URLs because the responses are sent in order. This problem\nis less severe in this transport protocol because connection are multiplexed, so\nsmall messages need not be blocked by large messages. Nevertheless, it is still\nthe case that the multiplexed stream of data for all connections must be\nreceived in order: it is not possible to push back on one lightweight connection\nvs another, only on the whole heavyweight connection.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/en/technical/protocols/network-transport/",doc_title:"Network Transport Layer",author:null,date:"2017-01-01",language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"technical-protocols"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/technical/protocols/2017-01-13-binary.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"Binary Protocols IMPORTANT: BINARY PROTOCOLS WILL BE CHANGED SOON.

If it doesn\'t\n-- find any checkpoint or depth of searching exceeds\n-- \'recoveryHeadersMessage\', it will try to find the newest checkpoint\n-- @cc@ from \'mghFrom\' that\'s in main chain of responding node and\n-- then return at most \'recoveryHeadersMessage\' headers starting with\n-- @cc@ as the oldest one, returning headers in range @l2 =\n-- [cc.next..x]@ where @x@ is either @top@ (in case @length l2 &#x3C;\n-- recoveryHeadersMessage@) or some arbitrary header (and length is\n-- precisely \'recoveryHeadersMessage\').\ndata MsgGetHeaders = MsgGetHeaders\n    { -- not guaranteed to be in any particular order\n      mghFrom :: ![HeaderHash]\n    , mghTo   :: !(Maybe HeaderHash)\n    } deriving (Generic, Show, Eq)\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c8620af754252ebb71b1f5bc369b4f672f46d537/src/Pos/Block/Network/Types.hs#L42">Source code\nlink</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field size</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1-9</td>\n<td>UVarInt Int</td>\n<td>n</td>\n<td>Number of checkpoints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>n \n*\n size(Hash)</td>\n<td>Hash\n[\nn\n]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>List of length \n<code>n</code>\n with hashes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Word8</td>\n<td>tag = 0x00 or 0x01</td>\n<td>Tag for optional \n<code>to</code>\n hash</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>tag \n*\n size(Hash)</td>\n<td>Hash</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>If tag is not \n<code>0x00</code>\n then hash of \n<code>to</code>\n block</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>GetBlocks</h3>\n<pre><code class="language-haskell">-- | \'GetBlocks\' message (see protocol specification).\ndata MsgGetBlocks = MsgGetBlocks\n    { mgbFrom :: !HeaderHash\n    , mgbTo   :: !HeaderHash\n    } deriving (Generic, Show, Eq)\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c8620af754252ebb71b1f5bc369b4f672f46d537/src/Pos/Block/Network/Types.hs#L54">Source code\nlink</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field size</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Field</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>size(Hash)</td>\n<td>Hash</td>\n<td><code>mgbFrom</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>size(Hash)</td>\n<td>Hash</td>\n<td><code>mgbTo</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Headers</h3>\n<pre><code class="language-haskell">-- | \'Headers\' message (see protocol specification).\nnewtype MsgHeaders ssc =\n    MsgHeaders (NewestFirst NE (BlockHeader ssc))\n    deriving (Generic, Show, Eq)\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c8620af754252ebb71b1f5bc369b4f672f46d537/src/Pos/Block/Network/Types.hs#L65">Source code\nlink</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field size</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1-9</td>\n<td>UVarInt Int</td>\n<td>n</td>\n<td>Number of block headers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>n \n*\n size(BlockHeader)</td>\n<td>BlockHeader\n[\nn\n]</td>\n<td></td>\n<td><code>n</code>\n block headers</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Block</h3>\n<pre><code class="language-haskell">-- | \'Block\' message (see protocol specification).\nnewtype MsgBlock ssc =\n    MsgBlock (Block ssc)\n    deriving (Generic, Show)\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c8620af754252ebb71b1f5bc369b4f672f46d537/src/Pos/Block/Network/Types.hs#L70">Source code\nlink</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field size</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1-9</td>\n<td>UVarInt Int64</td>\n<td>n</td>\n<td>Size of \n<code>Block</code>\n in bytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>size(Block)</td>\n<td>Block</td>\n<td></td>\n<td><code>Block</code>\n with size of \n<code>n</code>\n bytes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Contains one <code>Block</code>.

Nonetheless, this section covers the original client to great\nextent, assuming that it will be the initial reference client for some time.</p>\n<!-- end -->\n<h2>High-level overview</h2>\n<p>A Cardano SL node is a blockchain node. When ran, it finds other nodes (via\n<a href="http://ast-deim.urv.cat/cpairot/dhts.html">DHT</a>) and then starts performing\nblockchain-related procedures.</p>\n<p>Time in Cardano SL is divided into <em>epochs</em>. Every epoch is divided into\n<em>slots</em>. Epochs and slots are numbered. Therefore, the slot <code>(3,5)</code> is read as\n"the fifth slot of the third epoch" (the 0-th slot and the 0-th epoch are also\npossible).</p>\n<p>Cardano SL uses sets of constants, special values defined in\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/bf5dd592b7bf77a68bf71314718dc7a8d5cc8877/core/constants.yaml">the <code>constants.yaml</code> configuration file</a>.\nThere are two main sets: for production mode and development mode. In this guide\nwe\'ll refer to productions constants.</p>\n<p>Suppose the values for Cardano SL are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slot duration: 120 seconds,</li>\n<li>security parameter <em>k</em>: 60.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, <strong>a slot lasts 120 seconds</strong>, and an epoch has <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/9ee12d3cc9ca0c8ad95f3031518a4a7acdcffc56/core/Pos/Core/Constants/Raw.hs#L161"><code>10×k</code></a>\nslots in it, so it lasts <strong>1200 minutes</strong> or <strong>20 hours</strong>.</p>\n<p>There is one node called the slot leader on each slot. Only this node has right\nto generate a new block during this slot; this block will be added to the\nblockchain. However, there\'s no guarantee that new block will be actually\ngenerated (e.g. slot leader can be offline during a corresponding slot).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, slot leader may delegate its right to another node <code>N</code>; in this\ncase node <code>N</code> will have a right to generate a new block instead of slot leader.\nPlease note that node <code>N</code> with delegated right is not called a slot leader\nthough, it is just a delegate.</p>\n<p>It\'s theoretically possible to delegate the slot leader\'s right to multiple\nnodes, but it is <strong>not</strong> recommended by reasons explained later. Moreover, we can\nrun multiple nodes with the same key (i.e. on one computer), let\'s say nodes\n<code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, and if node <code>A</code> is elected as the slot leader, not only <code>A</code>\nitself, but nodes <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> will be able to generate a new block as well. In\nthis case, every one of these nodes will issue a most probably different block,\nand the network will fork — each other node will accept <strong>only one</strong> of these\nconcurrent blocks. Later, this fork will be eliminated.</p>\n<p>During the epoch, nodes send each other MPC messages to come to the consensus as\nto who would be allowed to generate blocks in the next epoch. Payloads from\n<code>Data</code> messages (along with transactions) are included into blocks.</p>\n<p>The more currency (or "stake") an address holds, the more likely it is to be\nchosen to generate a block. Please read about <a href="/cardano/proof-of-stake/">Ouroboros Proof of Stake Algorithm</a>\nfor more details.</p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>send messages,</li>\n<li>receive messages/transactions/etc,</li>\n<li>form a block (if you are the slot leader),</li>\n<li>repeat.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Business logic</h2>\n<h3>Listeners</h3>\n<p>Listeners handle incoming messages and respond to them. Various supplemental\nlisteners will not be covered, focusing on the main ones instead.</p>\n<p>Listeners mostly use the <a href="/en/technical/protocols/csl-application-level/#invreqdata-and-messagepart">Relay\nframework</a>,\nwhich includes three type of messages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Inventory</code> message: node publishes message to network when gets a new data.</li>\n<li><code>Request</code> message: node requests a new data which was published in\n<code>Inventory</code> message, from other node, if this data is not known yet by\nthis node.</li>\n<li><code>Data</code> message: node replies with this message on <code>Request</code> message. <code>Data</code>\nmessage contains concrete data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance, when a user creates a new transaction, the wallet sends\n<code>Inventory</code> message with transaction id to the network. If the node that has\nreceived <code>Inventory</code> doesn\'t know any transaction with such id, then it replies\nwith <code>Request</code> message, after that the wallet sends this transaction in <code>Data</code>\nmessage. After the node has received the <code>Data</code> message, it can send the\n<code>Inventory</code> message to its neighbors in DHT network and repeat previous\niterations again.</p>\n<p>Another example - block listeners <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L30"><code>handleGetHeaders</code></a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L50"><code>handleGetBlocks</code></a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L77"><code>handleBlockHeaders</code></a>.</p>\n<h3>Workers</h3>\n<p>A Worker is an action repeated with some interval. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/infra/Pos/Communication/Protocol.hs#L218"><code>onNewSlotWorker</code></a>: Runs at the beginning of each slot. Does some cleanup and\nthen runs additional functions. This worker also creates a\n<em>genesis block</em> at the beginning of the epoch. There are two kinds of\nblocks: "genesis blocks" and "main blocks". Main blocks are stored in the\nblockchain; genesis blocks are generated by each node internally between\nepochs. Genesis blocks aren\'t announced to other nodes. However, a node may\nrequest a genesis block from someone else for convenience, if this node was\noffline for some time and needs to catch up with the blockchain.</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/d01d392d49db8a25e17749173ec9bce057911191/src/Pos/Block/Worker.hs#L69"><code>blkOnNewSlot</code></a>: Creates\na new block (when it is the node\'s turn to create a new block) and announces it\nto other nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Proof of Stake</h2>\n<p>At the heart of Cardano SL sits the Ouroboros Proof of Stake protocol, as\ndescribed in <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889">the whitepaper</a> of the same\nname.</p>\n<h2>Forks</h2>\n<p>Generally, one chain (the <em>main chain</em>) is maintained by a node, but eventually\nalternative chains may arise. Recall that only blocks <code>k</code> and more slots deep are\nconsidered stable. This way, if a block which is neither a part nor a\ncontinuation of our blockchain is received, we first check if its complexity is\nbigger than ours (the complexity is the length of the chain), and then we start\nsubsequently requesting previous blocks from the node that provided an\nalternative chain header. If we come deeper than <code>k</code> slots ago, the alternative\nchain gets rejected. Otherwise, once we get to the block existing in our chain,\nthe alternative chain is added to storage. From the standpoint of state, we\nstore and maintain all the alternative chains that are viable. If it appears\nthat an alternative chain is longer than the main chain, they are swapped,\nmaking the alternative chain the new main chain.</p>\n<h2>Supplemental parts</h2>\n<h3>Slotting</h3>\n<p>The consensus scheme we use relies on correct slotting. More specifically, it\nrelies on the assumption that nodes in the system have access to the current\ntime (small deviations are acceptable), which is then used to figure out when\nany particular slot begins and ends, and perform particular actions in this\nslot.</p>\n<p>System start time is a timestamp of the <code>(0,0)</code> slot (i.e. the 0-th slot of the 0-th\nepoch).</p>\n<h2>P2P Network</h2>\n<h3>Peer discovery</h3>\n<p>We use Kademlia DHT for peer discovery. It is a general solution for distributed\nhash tables, based on <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf">a whitepaper by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières,\n2002</a>.</p>\n<p>However, we only take advantage of its peer discovery mechanism, and use none of\nits hash table capabilities.</p>\n<p>In short, each node in the Kademlia network is provided a <code>160</code>-bit id generated\nrandomly. The distance between the nodes is defined by <code>XOR</code> metric. The network\nis organized in such a way that node knows no more than <code>K</code> (<code>K=7</code> in the\noriginal client implementation) nodes for each relative distance range:\n<code>2^i &#x3C; d &#x3C;= 2^(i+1)</code>.</p>\n<p>Initial peer discovery is done by\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia/Implementation.hs#L194">sending</a>\na Kademlia <code>FIND_NODE</code> message with our own node id as a parameter to <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/43a2d079a026b90ba860e79b5be52d1337e26c6f/src/Pos/Constants.hs#L89">a\npre-configured set of\nnodes</a>\nand the nodes passed by the user on the command line. Our implementation\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/43a2d079a026b90ba860e79b5be52d1337e26c6f/infra/Pos/DHT/Real/Real.hs#L228">sends</a>\nthis request to all known peers at once and then waits for the first reply.</p>\n<p>While the client runs, it collects peers per Kademlia protocol. The list of\nknown peers is preserved and\n<a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia.hs#L197">restored</a>\nbetween subsequent launches. For each peer, we keep their <a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia/Types.hs#L42">host and port\nnumber</a>,\nas well as their <a href="https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia/Types.hs#L70">node\nid</a>.</p>\n<h3>Messaging</h3>\n<p>Kademlia already provides the notion of nodes that are known. Such nodes can be\ncalled <em>neighbors</em>. To send message to all nodes in a network, you can send it\nto neighbors, they will resend it to their neighbors, and so on. But sometimes\nwe may need to not propagate messages across all network, but send it to\nneighbors only. Hence we have three types of sending messages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>send to a node,</li>\n<li>send to neighbors,</li>\n<li>send to network.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Message types</h4>\n<p>To handle this, three kind of message headers are used, and there are two\nmessage types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple: sending to a single peer.</li>\n<li>Broadcast: attempting to send to the entire network, iteratively sending\nmessages to neighbors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Broadcast messages are resent to neighbors right after retrieval (before\nhandling). Also, they are being checked against LRU cache, and messages that\nhave been already received once get ignored.</p>\n<h3>Leaders and rich men computation (LRC)</h3>\n<p>"Slot leaders" and "rich men" are two important notions of Ouroboros Proof of\nStake Algorithm.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Slot leaders: Slot leaders for the current epoch (for each slot of the\ncurrent epoch) are computed by <a href="/en/cardano/proof-of-stake/#follow-the-satoshi">Follow the\nSatoshi</a> (FTS) algorithm in the\nbeginning of current epoch. FTS uses a <code>shared seed</code> which is result of\n<a href="/en/cardano/proof-of-stake/#multi-party-computation">Multi Party Computation</a>\n(MPC) algorithm for previous epoch: in the result of MPC some nodes reveal\ntheir seeds, <code>xor</code> of these seeds is called <code>shared seed</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rich men: Only nodes that have sent their VSS certificates and also have\nenough stake can participate in the MPC algorithm. So in the beginning of\nepoch node must know all potential participants for validation of MPC\nmessages during this epoch. Rich men are also computed in the beginning of\ncurrent epoch.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich men are important for other components as well; for instance, Update system\nuses rich men for checking that node can publish update proposal and vote.</p>\n<p>There are two ways of computing who the rich men will be: - considering common\nstake - considering delegated stake (Ouroboros provides opportunity to delegate\nown stake to other node, see more in <a href="/en/cardano/differences/#stake-delegation">Delegation\nsection</a>)</p>\n<p>MPC and Update System components need rich men with delegated stake, but\nDelegation component with common stake.</p>\n<h2>Constants</h2>\n<p>Cardano SL uses a list of the fundamental constants. Their values have been\ndiscussed with the original authors of the protocol as well as independent\nsecurity auditors, so reusing these constants is strongly recommended for\nalternative clients.</p>\n<p>Values of these constants are defined in\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/bf5dd592b7bf77a68bf71314718dc7a8d5cc8877/core/constants.yaml">the <code>constants.yaml</code> configuration file</a>,\nfor production and development environments separately.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/en/technical-details/",doc_title:"Technical details",author:null,date:"2017-01-02",language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"base"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/2017-01-04-installation.en.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"\n# Installation\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nSupported platforms are Windows, macOS and Linux.

Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed and developed by IOHK in conjunction with…",html:"<h3>WHAT IS CARDANO SL?</h3>\n<p>Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed and developed by IOHK in conjunction with the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the University of Connecticut. Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol” by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.</p>\n<p>You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws. Please read “What Makes Cardano SL Special?” for more information about similarities and differences between Cardano SL and Bitcoin.\nCRYPTOCURRENCY BASICS\nBefore giving a definition of a cryptocurrency, let’s talk about why we care about digital currencies in general and cryptographic currencies in particular.</p>\n<h3>WHY DO WE CARE?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h5>SPEED</h5>\n<p>As opposed to conventional (also known as fiat), centrally banked currencies, such as the Yen or the American Dollar, digital currencies do not require a banking system to move value. With this restriction lifted, working with digital currencies is much faster than working with banking, especially on a global scale. Transferring 10 USD from Osaka to Denver no longer takes days when a digital currency is used. All transactions are made rapidly regardless of the distance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h5>YOU OWN YOUR MONEY</h5>\n<p>All that a commercial bank account owner is given is a promise of being paid a certain amount of money within a reasonable amount of time after receiving a payout request. Banking systems also have limits to any volume of value being moved, rendering an individual unable to withdraw or transfer large amounts quickly. In case of cryptocurrencies, the person who holds a special kind of information called a secret key can spend the money at will. No other entity has a power to manipulate the value that a user owns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h5>PSEUDONYMITY</h5>\n<p>One can have as many cryptocurrency addresses as they wish, receiving and spending money from different addresses as per their purpose. A merchant running an E-Commerce shop can have a set of addresses for receiving money and issuing refunds, and a separate personal “wallet” for their own needs. A single interface is used to control all of these wallets, and there is no need to log in to several payment platforms, which makes the process very time-efficient.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h5>SECURITY</h5>\n<p>Your money is as secure as the secret key that allows spending it. This means that storing your secret key on a USB flash drive in a safe is equivalent to having banknotes in a safe. Absolutely nobody can steal this money even by carrying out a successful cyberattack.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>EXTENSIBILITY</h3>\n<p>Using an approach known as side chains, general purpose cryptocurrencies such as Cardano SL or Bitcoin can enable domain specific cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum Classic. This way, any innovation developed via domain specific cryptocurrency can have participants who hold value in a general purpose cryptocurrency. Examples of such applications are identity management, gaming and gambling, and verifiable computations.</p>\n<h3>WHAT IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY?</h3>\n<p>Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography to manipulate value. Cryptography provides a way to generate proof of genuine authenticity of any kind of information. This is called digital signing. In cryptocurrencies we generate a ledger (a database which provides information on how much money each address has) by signing and sending transactions to the network and receiving blocks of confirmed transactions. Cryptocurrencies are normally decentralized, meaning that many people from all over the globe participate in ledger generation by running cryptocurrency nodes. Thus, a consensus about the state of the ledger has to be achieved. Two most significant approaches for achieving such consensus are discussed in the next section.</p>\n<h3>WHAT MAKES CARDANO SL SPECIAL?</h3>\n<p>While there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many differences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference is that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes use of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and long term participation.</p>\n<h3>PURPOSE OF A CONSENSUS ALGORITHM</h3>\n<p>Consensus algorithms are used to produce new transaction blocks, resulting in an updated state of the ledger. Whenever someone publishes a block of transactions, they — or rather, their node that runs the cryptocurrency protocol — have to attach a proof that they have merited it. Below two types of such proofs are discussed.</p>\n<h3>PROOF OF WORK AND MINING</h3>\n<p>Proof of work is the most common consensus algorithm type for cryptocurrencies. It originated in Bitcoin, and this is how this cryptocurrency works. To generate proof of work, a computer has to solve a challenge. The challenge is a computationally heavy problem which is hard to solve, but the solution is easy to verify. When a computer on a proof of work based network finds a solution, it publishes it along with the transactions that the computer has been observing while cracking the problem. The owner of this computer collects the transaction fees and a reward for generating a block. The entire process is called mining. Mining is very energy consuming, and the amount of energy needed is constantly increasing, which can lead to unsound competition.</p>\n<h3>PROOF OF STAKE AND MINTING</h3>\n<p>Proof of stake is a novel approach to block generation. IOHK scientists led by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias have designed the first provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros. Ouroboros lies at the heart of Cardano SL. Research team has published a white paper that is a worthy read for anyone with a background in cryptocurrency theory. The core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking computationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a probability proportional to the amount of coins this node has. If a node has positive (> 0) stake, it is called a stakeholder. If a node eventually becomes chosen to mint a block, it is called a slot leader. You can read more about this process in Proof of Stake in Cardano SL.</p>\n<h3>BEYOND SETTLEMENT LAYER</h3>\n<p>Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.</p>",frontmatter:{path:"/en/intro-text/",doc_title:null,author:null,date:null,language:"en",label:"content",keywords:"intro",group:null}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/content/welcome-text.cn.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"Dear reader, the purpose of this documentation is to provide you with understanding of the first layer of Cardano Platform stack, the…",html:'<p>Dear reader, the purpose of this documentation is to provide you with understanding of the first layer of Cardano Platform stack, the Settlement Layer.

This type will allow us to use\ncustom types of addresses in the future.</p>\n<h2>What Does an Address Look Like?</h2>\n<p>Addresses are <code>base58</code>-encoded bytestrings, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>Ae2tdPwUPEZKmwoy3AU3cXb5Chnasj6mvVNxV1H11997q3VW5ihbSfQwGpm\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Encoding</h3>\n<p><code>base58</code> encoding is the same one as used in Bitcoin. It uses a 58-symbol alphabet\nto encode data, hence the name. Here is the alphabet we are using:</p>\n<pre><code>123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz\n</code></pre>\n<p>It avoids both non-alphanumeric characters and letters which might look\nambiguous when printed (<code>0</code>, <code>O</code>, <code>I</code>, <code>l</code>); therefore it is suitable for human\nusers who enter the data manually, copying it from some visual source, and also\nallows easy copy and paste by double-clicking which usually selects the whole\nstring.</p>\n<h2>Public Key Addresses</h2>\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href="/introduction/#you-own-your-money">Introduction</a>, the wallets\nyou can see in the user interface are a convenient representation of the fact that\nyou own a secret key to spend money in this particular wallet. But how is such\nspending verified by the network and how can you receive money from others? The\nanswer is that along with the secret key which is used to control the value in\nyour wallets, a public key is generated. This public component can be known by\nanybody, hence the name.</p>\n<p>A public key address contains the hash of this public key.</p>\n<p>Public keys are also used for verifying your identity when you create a\ntransaction and other auxiliary purposes.</p>\n<h2>Pay to Script Hash</h2>\n<p>The idea of Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) is to provide a lot of flexibility for\nformulating complex rules for spending money. Instead of sending a transaction\nto a public key address, we create a validator script that can take a so-called\nredemption script as a parameter. To redeem funds, we pass the redemption script\nto the validator and evaluate it. If it evaluates to <code>success</code>, money is sent as\nspecified by the redeemer. Otherwise nothing happens.</p>\n<p>To quote Bitcoin Wiki,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using P2SH, you can send bitcoins to an address that is secured in various\nunusual ways without knowing anything about the details of how the security is\nset up. The recipient might need the signatures of several people to spend\nthese bitcoins, or a password might be required, or the requirements could be\ncompletely unique.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Redeem Addresses</h2>\n<p>Redeem addresses are Pay To PubKey Hash (P2PKH). Such an address contains the hash\nof redeem public key, and this key is actually <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>\npublic key.</p>\n<h2>Other Address Types</h2>\n<p>In the future, we may use the update system to introduce other address types. Please\n<a href="/cardano/update-mechanism/#soft-fork-updates">see more</a> on extending the system in\nnon-breaking fashion.</p>\n<h2>Address Structure</h2>\n<p>Address consists of 3 parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>address root,</li>\n<li>address attributes,</li>\n<li>address type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can imagine an address as a JSON-like structure, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>Address {\n    addrRoot = AbstractHash e63175c654dfd93a9290342a067158dc0f57a1108ddbd8cace3839bd,\n    addrAttributes = Attributes {\n        data: AddrAttributes {\n            aaPkDerivationPath = Nothing,\n            aaStakeDistribution = BootstrapEraDistr\n        } \n    },\n    addrType = ATPubKey\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>addrRoot</code> is the BLAKE2b-224 hash of the tuple made from <code>addrType</code>, <code>addrSpendingData</code> and <code>addrAttributes</code>.</p>\n<p><code>addrSpendingData</code> is a special value which is bound to an address and must be revealed in order to spend coins belonging to\nthis address. For example, for public key address this value contains the public key. In this case, it is impossible to change\naddress attributes without knowing of the public key because if the attributes have been changed the whole address becomes\ninvalid.</p>\n<p><code>addrAttributes</code> include important attributes of each address: derivation path and stake distribution.</p>\n<p>For more info about derivation path please read <a href="https://cardanodocs.com/technical/hd-wallets/">HD Wallets in Cardano SL</a> chapter.</p>\n<p>For more info about stake distribution please read <a href="https://cardanodocs.com/cardano/transactions/#stake-distribution">Transactions in Cardano SL</a>\nchapter.</p>\n<p>Value of <code>addrType</code> corresponds to address type as was mentioned above, in this example it is a public key address.</p>\n<h3>Length</h3>\n<p>Addresses may have different lengths depending on address type and additional data in it.</p>\n<p>For example, this address</p>\n<pre><code>Ae2tdPwUPEZKmwoy3AU3cXb5Chnasj6mvVNxV1H11997q3VW5ihbSfQwGpm\n</code></pre>\n<p>and this one</p>\n<pre><code>4swhHtxKapQbj3TZEipgtp7NQzcRWDYqCxXYoPQWjGyHmhxS1w1TjUEszCQT1sQucGwmPQMYdv1FYs3d51KgoubviPBf\n</code></pre>\n<p>are both public key addresses.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/en/cardano/addresses/",doc_title:"Addresses",author:null,date:null,language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"cardano"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/cardano/2017-02-01-monetary-policy.en.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:'<!-- Reviewed at 1bd2a2f5979233f4f50a7e66ab4e1819ac486400 -->\n\n# Cardano Monetary Policy\n\n<div  markdown="1">\nThis section defines the Cardano monetary policy.\n\n### THE LAUNCH OF CARDANO AND AVAILABILITY OF ADA\n\nDuring the sale that occurred at the launch, 25,927,070,538 Ada were sold.

For example, a transaction of size 200 bytes (a fairly typical size) costs:</p>\n<pre><code>0.155381 ADA + 0.000043946 ADA/byte × 200 byte = 0.1641702 ADA.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The reason for having parameter <code>a</code> is the prevention of DDoS attacks mentioned above: even a very small dummy\ntransaction should cost enough to hurt an attacker who tries to generate many thousands of them.</p>\n<p>Parameter <code>b</code> has been introduced to reflect actual costs: storing larger transactions needs more computer memory\nthan storing smaller transactions, so larger transactions should be more expensive than smaller ones.</p>\n<p>Although particular values for parameters <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> were calculated, these values will probably be adjusted in\nfuture to better reflect actual costs.</p>\n<h2>Transaction fees distribution</h2>\n<p>All transaction fees of a given <a href="https://cardanodocs.com/glossary/#epoch">epoch</a> are collected in a virtual pool,\nand the idea is to then redistribute the money from that pool amongst people who were elected <a href="https://cardanodocs.com/glossary/#slot-leader">slot leaders</a>\nby the PoS-algorithm during that epoch and who created blocks.</p>\n<p>At this stage of Cardano SL, where all blocks are created by nodes operated by IOHK and our partners, fees are\nalready collected (to prevent DDoS attacks), but they will not be distributed and instead will be burnt.</p>\n<p>As soon as Cardano SL enters its next, <a href="https://cardanoroadmap.com/">fully decentralized stage</a>, fees will be\ndistributed as described above.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/en/cardano/transaction-fees/",doc_title:"Transaction Fees",author:null,date:null,language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"cardano"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/cardano/2017-01-04-differences.en.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"<!-- Reviewed at c4c45ce9a7a8f4aa6d88a32829755196a017f6a1 -->\n\n# Differences Between the Ouroborous Protocol Paper and the Implementation\n\nThe goal of this document is to outline the ways in which the Cardano SL\nimplementation differs from the specifications presented in the *Ouroboros*\nprotocol [paper](/glossary/#paper) and to clarify any outstanding questions \nafter reading the paper.\n\nThis document is divided into four parts:\n\n1.  *Clarifications* - clarifies any details that are not specified in the\n    paper, but are important for practical implementations.\n2.  *Modifications* - outlines elements that are specified in the paper, but are\n    implemented differently in Cardano SL.\n3.  *Added features* - briefly outlines new features which are not described\n    in the paper, but have been implemented in Cardano SL.\n4.  *Omissions* - lists topics described in the paper but are not yet implemented into\n    Cardano SL.\n",

However, there are no details on how to obtain the current time value securely\nand with enough precision.</p>\n<p>In Cardano SL, the current time value is obtained from a user\'s computer system time value.</p>\n<p>We also have a feature to notify users if their system time is incorrect\n(we compare it with the time value that is obtained from NTP servers). This feature is planned for a future release.</p>\n<h2>Coin Tossing and Verifiable Secret Sharing</h2>\n<p>The paper suggests PVSS (Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing) scheme by Schoenmakers for Cardano SL. However,\ncurrently Cardano SL uses <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/216.pdf">"SCRAPE: Scalable Randomness Attested by\nPublic Entities"</a> PVSS scheme.</p>\n<p>One of the challenges while using a VSS (Verifiable Secret Sharing) scheme is associating the\npublic key used for signing with the public key used for the VSS scheme\n(<code>VssPublicKey</code>). This is solved by introducing <code>VssCertificate</code>s. This\ncertificate is a signature given by a signing key for a pair consisting of\n<code>VssPublicKey</code> and the epoch until which this certificate is valid. Initially,\nall stakeholders with stake enough for participation in randomness generation\nhold certificates. When a new stakeholder with enough stake appears, or when an\nexisting certificate expires, a new certificate should be generated and\nsubmitted to the network. <code>VssCertificate</code>s are stored in blocks.</p>\n<p>PVSS scheme uses share verification information which also\nincludes a commitment to the secret. It is also used as a commitment in\nthe protocol. The PVSS scheme has been implemented over the elliptic curve\nsecp256r1. Please refer to <a href="/technical/pvss/">PVSS implementation in Cardano\nSL</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Block Generation Time</h2>\n<p>In the paper, they do not state explicitly when a slot leader should\ngenerate a new block and send it to the network: it can be done at the beginning\nof a slot, at the end of a slot, in the middle of a slot, etc. In Cardano SL\nthere is a special constant called "network diameter" which approximates maximal time\nnecessary to broadcast a block to all nodes in the network. For example, if network\ndiameter is 3, then block is generated and announced 3 seconds before the end of a slot.</p>\n<h2>Stake Delegation</h2>\n<p>Delegation scheme, as described in the paper, does not explicitly state whether proxy\nsigning certificates should be stored within the blockchain (though there is a\nsuggestion to store the revocation list in the blockchain). Without storing\nproxy signing certificates in the blockchain it is barely possible to consider\ndelegated stake in checking eligibility threshold. On the other hand, if all\ncertificates are stored in the blockchain, it may lead to a blockchain bloat\nwhen a big portion of blocks will be occupied by proxy certificates. Submitting\na certificate is free, so adversaries can generate as many certificates as they\nwant.</p>\n<p>There are two types of delegation in Cardano SL: heavyweight and lightweight.\nThere is a threshold on stake that one has to posses in order to participate in\nheavyweight delegation. Proxy signing certificates from heavyweight delegation\nare stored within the blockchain. On the contrary, lightweight delegation is\navailable for everybody, but certificates are not stored within the blockchain\nand are not considered when checking eligibility threshold. As the paper suggests,\n<em>delegation-by-proxy</em> scheme is used.</p>\n<p>Please read about <a href="/technical/delegation/">Stake Delegation in Cardano SL</a> for\nimplementation details.</p>\n<h1>Modifications</h1>\n<h2>Leader Selection Process</h2>\n<p>In the paper, Leader Selection Process is described as flipping a\n<code>(1 - p₁) … (1 - pⱼ₋₁) pⱼ</code>-biased coin to see whether the <code>j</code>-th stakeholder is\nselected as the leader of the given slot. Here <code>pⱼ</code> is probability of selecting the <code>j</code>-th\nstakeholder.</p>\n<p>In Cardano SL, it is implemented in a slightly different way. <code>R</code> random\nnumbers in a range <code>[0 .. totalCoins]</code> are generated, where <code>R</code> is a number of\nslots in an epoch. Stakeholders occupy different subsegments on this range,\nproportional to their stakes. This way, each random number maps into stakeholder.\nAlso, as the paper suggests, a short (32-bits) seed is used for initializing PRG\ninstead of using <code>n ⌈log λ⌉</code> random bits.</p>\n<p>Please read about <a href="/technical/leader-selection/">Leader Selection in Cardano SL</a>\nfor implementation details.</p>\n<h2>Commitments, openings, shares sending</h2>\n<p>Time of sending is randomized within a small interval. It is done to avoid network\noverload when all coin-tossing participants send their data at the same time.\nThis interval is chosen to be small enough for protocol to remain secure. If\nthis data is sent too late and there are many adversaries leading last few slots\nof a certain phase, it can happen that data will not be included into the block.</p>\n<h2>Multishares</h2>\n<p>In the paper, each stakeholder is presented as exactly one participant of the\nunderlying VSS scheme. However, it is natural that a stakeholder with more stake\nis more important than a stakeholder with less stake with regards to secret\nsharing. For instance, if three honest stakeholders control 60% of stake in\ntotal (each of them controls 20%) and there are 40 adversary stakeholders each\nhaving 1% of stake, then the adversary has full control over secret sharing.</p>\n<p>To overcome this problem, a number of shares for each stakeholder proportional\nto their stake is generated in Cardano SL.</p>\n<h2>Randomness Generation Failure</h2>\n<p>The paper does not cover the situation when commitments cannot be recovered.\nHowever, a practical implementation should account for such scenarios.\nCardano SL implementation uses a seed consisting of all zeroes if there are no\ncommitments that could be recovered.</p>\n<h1>Added Features</h1>\n<h2>Update System</h2>\n<p>See the article on <a href="/cardano/update-mechanism/">update system</a>.</p>\n<h2>Security of P2P</h2>\n<p>See the article on <a href="/technical/protocols/p2p/">P2P implementation and\nhardening</a>.</p>\n<h1>Omissions</h1>\n<p>The sections on <em>Input Endorsers</em> and <em>Incentive Structure</em> are not implemented\nyet. Those sections are to be implemented together with the pending research on\nSide-chains and released within the Side-chains release.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/en/cardano/differences-between-paper-and-the-implementation/",doc_title:"Differences Between Paper and the Implementation",author:null,date:null,language:"en",label:"docs",keywords:null,group:"cardano"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/robinclark/iohk-sites/cardanodocs.com/src/pages/en/docs/cardano/2017-02-05-explorer.en.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",excerpt:"<!-- Reviewed at dec0d911d6c4beb8e708ed4076f832ff871f6125 -->\n\n# Cardano SL Explorer\n\nThis is an overview of Cardano SL Explorer service (hereafter referred to as\n\"Explorer\").\n\nExplorer is an [online service](https://cardanoexplorer.com/) for searching\naddresses, transactions, epochs and slots on the Cardano network.\n\n## Address\n\nIt is possible to find information about users' addresses.

By “relative\nvalue” we mean “all the total value held by wallets on a particular node divided by\nthe total value in the Cardano SL system”. For more information, please see:\n<a href="/cardano/balance-and-stake/">Balance and Stake in Cardano SL</a></p>\n<h2>About Slot Leaders</h2>\n<p>Nodes with a positive stake are called stakeholders, and only stakeholders may\nparticipate in running the protocol. Moreover, to be able to generate new blocks\nfor the blockchain, a stakeholder must be elected as a slot leader. The slot leader can\nlisten to transactions announced by other nodes, make a block of those transactions,\nsign this block with its secret key and publish it to the network.</p>\n<p>You can think of a slot leader as a miner in bitcoin, but the above-mentioned consensus\ndefines who will be able to mine, when and how much.</p>\n<h2>Epochs and Slots</h2>\n<p>The Ouroboros protocol divides the physical time into <strong>epochs</strong>, and each epoch is\ndivided into <strong>slots</strong>. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>+----------+----------+-------+----------+--------------------> t\n|  slot 0  |  slot 1  |  ...  |  slot N  |\n\n \\                                      / \\\n  -------------- epoch M ---------------   -- epoch M+1 -- ...\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> a slot is a relatively short period of time (for example, 20 seconds).</p>\n<p>Each slot has one and only one leader (slot leader, SL):</p>\n<pre><code>+----------+----------+-------+----------+----> t\n|  slot 0  |  slot 1  |  ...  |  slot N  |\n\n    SL 0       SL 1               SL N\n</code></pre>\n<p>The slot leader has a (sole) right to produce one and only one block during his slot:</p>\n<pre><code>  +------+   +------+           +------+\n  | Bl 0 |&#x3C;--| Bl 1 |&#x3C;-- ... &#x3C;--| Bl N |\n  +------+   +------+           +------+\n+----------+----------+-------+----------+----> t\n|  slot 0  |  slot 1  |  ...  |  slot N  |\n\n    SL 0       SL 1               SL N\n</code></pre>\n<p>It means that the number of slot leaders is strictly equal to the number of slots\nin epoch (let\'s call this number <code>N</code>), so it is impossible to produce more than <code>N</code>\nblocks during an epoch.</p>\n<p>If slot leader missed their slot (for example, when offline), the right to produce\na block is lost until they are elected again.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> One or more slots can remain empty (without generated blocks), but the\nmajority of blocks (at least 50% + 1) <strong>must</strong> be generated during an epoch.</p>\n<h2>How Slot Leaders Elections Work</h2>\n<p>Slot leaders are elected from the group of all stakeholders. Please note that not all\nstakeholders participate in this election, but only ones who have enough stake (for example, 2% of\nthe total stake). This group of stakeholders are known as “electors”.</p>\n<p>Electors elect slot leaders for the next epoch during the current epoch. Thus, at the end of epoch\n<code>N</code> it is already known who are slot leaders for the epoch <code>N+1</code>, and it cannot be\nchanged.</p>\n<p>You can think of this election as a “fair lottery”; anyone from the group of stakeholders can\nbecome a slot leader. However, an important idea of PoS is that the more stake stakeholder has,\nthe more chances one has to be elected as a slot leader. </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> One stakeholder can be elected as a slot leader for more than one slot\nduring the same epoch.</p>\n<h3>Multiparty Computation</h3>\n<p>One of the fundamental problems of the slot leader election process is its unbiasedness.\nA certain degree of randomness is needed as a base for election, in this case, results of\nthis election are random and fair. So the question is where can this randomness be obtained\nfrom?</p>\n<p>A multiparty computation (MPC) approach is used to achieve this randomness where each elector\nindependently performs an action which is called “coin tossing” and after that shares results\nwith other electors. The idea is that results are randomly generated by each elector, but eventually\nthey agree on the same final value.</p>\n<h4>Commitment Phase</h4>\n<p>First of all, an elector generates a secret (or special random value). Next, an elector forms a\n“commitment” which is a message that contains encrypted shares (see an explanation below) and\nproof of secret.</p>\n<p>The next step is when an elector signs this commitment with its secret key, specifies the epoch\'s\nnumber and attaches its public key. In this case, everybody can check who created this commitment\nand which epoch this commitment relates to.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, an elector sends its commitment to other electors, so eventually each elector collects\ncommitments from all other electors.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> these commitments are put into the block, that is, they become a part of the blockchain.</p>\n<h4>Reveal Phase</h4>\n<p>The reveal phase is where an elector sends an “opening”, or special value for opening a commitment.\nA commitment is like a locked box (with a secret in it), and the act of opening involves a key that\nopens the box retrieves the secret.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> all openings are put into the block, that is, they become a part of the blockchain.</p>\n<h4>Recovery Phase</h4>\n<p>The final phase in the process is called the recovery phase.</p>\n<p>Eventually, an elector has both commitments and openings. Theoretically some electors can be an\nadversary and can publish its commitment but <strong>not</strong> publish its opening.</p>\n<p>In this case, the honest electors can post all shares (mentioned above) to reconstruct the\nsecret. The idea is simple: an election finishes successfully even if some electors are adversaries.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, an elector verifies that commitments and openings match, and if so, extracts the\nsecrets from the commitments and forms a seed (randomly generated byte string) from these secrets.\nSo all electors get the same seed, and it will be used for Follow the Satoshi (FTS) algorithm.</p>\n<h3>Follow the Satoshi</h3>\n<p>At this moment, electors have the seed (randomness we need). Now they have to select a particular slot\nleaders for the next epoch. This is where the Follow the Satoshi (FTS) algorithm comes into effect:</p>\n<pre><code>         +-----+\nSEED --->| FTS |---> ELECTED_SLOT_LEADERS\n         +-----+\n</code></pre>\n<p>To explain how a slot leader gets selected, think of the smallest, atomic piece\nof value as a coin called “<a href="/glossary/#lovelace">Lovelace</a>”. Fundamentally, the ledger produces the\ndistribution of coins, and since slot leaders can only be selected from stakeholders distribution of\nstake. FTS is an algorithm that verifiably picks a coin, and when coin owned by stakeholder <code>S</code> selected,\n<code>S</code> become a slot leader. It is clear that the more coins <code>S</code> has, the higher the probability that one\nof his coins will be picked.</p>\n<p>The reason why it is called “Follow the Satoshi” is that in bitcoin, an atomic piece of currency\nis called “Satoshi”, honoring Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin. </p>\n<h2>Honest Majority</h2>\n<p>The fundamental assumption of a protocol is known as <strong>honest majority</strong>. This means that\nparticipants owning at least 50% + 1 of the total stake are honest ones. In this\ncase we can <strong>prove</strong> that adversaries cannot break <em>persistence</em> and <em>liveness</em>\nof the blockchain.

Please\nnote that if the network is under high load, it may take a lot of time for\ntransaction to be actually added to the block.</p>\n<!-- end -->\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>Each transaction contains a list of <em>inputs</em> and a list of <em>outputs</em>; outputs of\nthe transaction <code>Tx0</code> can be used as inputs of the other transaction <code>Tx1</code>, and\nso on:</p>\n<pre><code>            Tx0                           Tx1\n  +----------------------+      +----------------------+\n  |                      |      |                      |\n  |  Inputs     Outputs  |      |  Inputs     Outputs  |\n  | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n  | | In0  |   | Out0  + |      | | In0  |   | Out0  | |\n  | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n  | | In1  |   | Out1  | |      | | In1  |   | Out1  | |\n  | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n  | | ...  |   | ...   | |      | | ..   |   | ...   | |\n  | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n  | | InN  |   | OutM  | |      | | InN  |   | OutM  | |\n  | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n  |                      |      |                      |\n  +----------------------+      +----------------------+     ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inputs and outputs carry information about <em>money flow</em>: inputs inform where the\nmoney came from, and outputs inform where the money comes to.

In this case, we treat such output as <em>spent transaction output</em>.\nThus, an output <code>Out0</code> of the transaction <code>891971a4cc31e32..</code> is a spent output,\nbecause it already is an input of the <code>f9bcbe752aee4512..</code> transaction.</p>\n<p>But such spendings do not occur immediately, so an output that <em>isn't yet</em> an\ninput of another transaction is called an <em>unspent transaction output</em>. Only\nunspent outputs can be used as inputs for other transactions, to prevent\n<a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending\">double-spending</a>.</p>\n<p>So every node in the network not only accepts transactions, but also\nverifies them. To do it, every node has to keep track of unspent outputs, it\nallows to validate that inputs in a published transaction are indeed the unspent\noutputs. Actually, all unspent outputs called <em>utxo</em>, and this is a part of the\nspecial key-value database called <em>Global State</em>.</p>\n<h2>Proofs of Transaction Legitimacy</h2>\n<p>Each transaction in Cardano SL is accompanied by a proof (also called a <strong>witness</strong>)\nthat this transaction is legitimate. Even if the output is an unspent one, we\nhave to prove that we have <em>a right</em> to spend it. Since a <code>TxN</code> transaction can\nhave many inputs, the witness for it consists of the witnesses of all <code>TxN</code>'s\ninputs, and only if all the inputs are legitimate, <code>TxN</code> is legitimate too. If a\nparticular transaction isn't legitimate, it will be rejected by the network.</p>\n<p>Because of <a href=\"/cardano/addresses/#what-does-an-address-look-like\">two available types of node\naddress</a> we use two\ncorresponding versions of the witness: based on <em>public key</em> and based on\n<em>script</em>.</p>\n<p>For example, the first option works with a public key <code>PK</code> and a transaction\nsignature: legitimate input must be signed with a private key corresponding to <code>PK</code>.\nSo it's possible to check this signature and either accept that input or reject it.</p>\n<p>Witnesses are stored in the blockchain and anybody can see, inspect and\nindependently verify them. But after some time a node may delete old proofs in\norder to save space. The technique of storing transactions separately from their\nproofs is called \"segregated witness\" (you may have heard of it being recently\n<a href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/\">implemented in\nBitcoin</a>). Under this\nscheme, transactions and proofs are stored in two separate places in a block,\nand can be processed independently.</p>\n<h2>Stake Distribution</h2>\n<p>Stake distribution is another part of Cardano SL, not directly related to delegation,\nbut one we can exploit for its benefit.</p>\n<p>Some addresses have multiple owners, which poses a problem of stake computation as per\nFollow-the-Satoshi each coin should only be counted once towards each stakeholder's stake total.\nUnlike balance (real amount of coins on the balance), stake gives user power to control different\nalgorithm parts: being the slot leader, voting in Update system, taking part in MPC/SSC.</p>\n<p>Stake distribution is a value associated with each address. Technically stake distribution is a value\nwhich is a part of address' attributes. This value corresponds to one of three different cases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bootstrap era distribution. This is a special value which is mandatory in Bootstrap era, but it can be used\nafter Bootstrap era as well.</li>\n<li>Single key distribution, which means that all stake will go to the given stakeholder.\nIn this case distribution contains stakeholder's identifier.</li>\n<li>Multiple key distribution, which means that stake will go to the multiple stakeholders (at least two).\nIn this case distribution contains pairs \"stakeholder's identifier - portion of an output\".\nTransaction's output has a value, portion of this value is a stake.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Stake distributions are considered by both <a href=\"https://cardanodocs.com/technical/leader-selection/\">slot-leader election process</a>\nand Richmen Computations.</p>\n<p>This feature can be used in similar way to <a href=\"https://cardanodocs.com/technical/delegation/\">delegation</a>, but there\nare differences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is no certificate(s): to revoke stake delegation <code>A</code> has to move funds, providing\ndifferent stake distribution.</li>\n<li>The portion of <code>A</code>'s stake can be delegated via distribution. On the contrary, delegation\nrequires you to delegate all funds of whole address at once.</li>\n</ol>",

It introduces some overhead to blockchain processing, but has\nseveral important benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For each client implementing the protocol, its latest version from\nblockchain is known.</li>\n<li>There is no central entity responsible for maintaining or distributing\nupdates, any such update is proposed under implicit or explicit agreement of\nthe majority of stake and then distributed in a decentralized way.</li>\n<li>We do not rely upon clients updating the software on their PCs in time; this\nis done automatically, and updates are announced directly via the\nblockchain.</li>\n<li>If any security flaws are detected in some version of the CSL protocol or in\nsome particular implementation, there would be a mechanism to distribute an\nupdate rapidly (and still under agreement of the majority of stake).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Application Update: Sign and Announce</h2>\n<p>Here we consider ways to update the application securely. Protocol updates are a\nseparate issue which is covered in the relevant section of this document.</p>\n<p>For an update to be applied, its proposal needs be approved first. Update\nproposal can be approved if at least one of two agreements is reached:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Explicit agreement</strong>: it has positive votes from majority of total stake\n(i. e. strictly greater than <code>50%</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>Implicit agreement</strong>: it has positive votes from more stake than negative\nvotes \ufeff⁠⁠⁠and\ufeff⁠⁠⁠ it has been in blockchain for at least <code>U</code> slots.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach seems to fit naturally into the CSL model, as in a PoS\ncryptocurrency every stakeholder is responsible for maintaining the system\nproportionally to the relative size of their stake, and the blockchain is\nmaintained via consensus among stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Software updates are a part of this maintenance process too, so the stakeholders\nshould agree on whether to consider this update trusted.</p>\n<h3>Implicit Agreement</h3>\n<p>The fact that stakeholders are responsible for system updates does not restrict\nus to a system where every single update requires a signature from the majority\nof stake. We can introduce the concept of an <strong>implicit agreement</strong>.</p>\n<p>An update has to have at least minimal bound (<code>updateProposalThd</code> in\n<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/e26ad11397c87ce8b00f2a26d5e237f54d6ea90a/lib/configuration.yaml">configuration.yaml</a>.)\nof the stake signatures to be published on\nthe blockchain. It is not enough for stakeholders to sign the update — they\nshould vote either for or against it.</p>\n<h3>Incorporation of Alternative Clients</h3>\n<p>IOHK will maintain a single official client. But there is also room for\nthird-party alternative clients maintained by the community. One requires enough\ncollected signatures from stakeholders to publish their system update, which may\nbe not an «update», but a different client developed from scratch, or a fork of\nthe official client. As long as this update has enough signatures from\nstakeholders, the network considers it trusted, and it is updated via the same\nmechanisms as the official client.</p>\n<h2>Application Update: Deliver and Apply</h2>\n<p>А list of HTTP mirrors ran by IOHK shall be sufficient for a start.</p>\n<p>In process of time, we plan to maintain a Bittorrent-based or Bittorrent-like\nsolution to distribute updates. In general, P2P update distribution is a crucial\nbusiness requirement due to legal concerns. It is to be decided which\nBittorrent-like solution particular we will use.</p>\n<p>Also, it’s interesting to note that the update itself does not require a secure\nand trusted channel to be used for delivery, as it is signed with some known in\nadvance and trusted key (or set of keys).</p>\n<p>Application updates are prepared with\n<a href="https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff">bsdiff</a> and applied either directly or via\nan installer. We\'re considering migrating to\n<a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/software-updates-courgette">courgette</a>\nin the future.</p>\n<h2>Protocol Update</h2>\n<p>First, we need to distinguish hard and soft protocol updates.</p>\n<p>A soft fork proposes modifying blockchain consensus rules so that the new\nversion blocks are still compatible with old version clients. A hard fork is one\nthat doesn’t maintain backward compatibility with the previous version.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/ed283b05b332b85b6fd683be3a5d73fab6c15554/bip-0099.mediawiki">BIP-99</a>\nprovides excellent criteria to distinguish between these two fork types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>soft fork</strong> introduces new rules, or restrictions, on blocks. That way,\neverything that was previously invalid remains invalid, while some blocks\nthat would have been previously considered valid become invalid.</li>\n<li>A <strong>hard fork</strong> is a fork that makes previously invalid blocks valid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Soft forks have some deployment advantages like backward compatibility, and they\ndon\'t require everyone\'s consensus, as the stake majority of users can impose\nthe new rules. By contrast, hard forks require all users to upgrade.</p>\n<p>In theory, a hard fork may lead to a situation when a network splits into two\nparts, each maintaining a separate chain: one from the nodes that adopted the\nlatest system update, and another from the nodes that rejected to do that. This\nmeans some blocks from the first part are considered invalid by the other part,\nand vice versa.</p>\n<p>We define <strong>protocol version</strong> as a tuple <code>(Maj, Min, Alt)</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Major version (2 bytes): to be changed rarely, changes are not\nbackward-compatible and would produce a hard fork.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minor version (2 bytes): integer to be adjusted for each update.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes should be backward-compatible in a sense that a block generated\nby the new version shall be somehow accepted by old version.</li>\n<li>A particular block may contain addresses of unknown type. For each case\nlike this, a concise workaround should be found in order not to affect\nstability and correctness of the system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alt version (1 byte): integer to manage several simultaneous protocol update\nproposals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The protocol version is to be announced in the application update, and is to be\nput later into each block created by updated software.</p>\n<p>A major version change triggers a hard fork in the future.</p>\n<p>A minor version change notifies the network that the subsequent application\nupdate modifies the protocol managed by a soft fork.</p>\n<p>Alt version is a marker of new features. It allows independent developers to\nintroduce multiple changes to the protocol simultaneously. For example, if one\nvendor decides to introduce feature X via a soft fork, and another proposes\nfeature Y (also via a soft fork), their software will be issuing blocks with\nversions <code>a.b.X</code> and <code>a.b.Y</code>, which can coexist in the blockchain. However, only\none will eventually be adopted.</p>\n<h2>Soft Fork Updates</h2>\n<p>There is a thin line between what we can do within a soft fork and what we\ncannot:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An old version of the client should always find recent blocks valid. (This\nis what\n<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/ed283b05b332b85b6fd683be3a5d73fab6c15554/bip-0099.mediawiki">BIP-99</a>\ncalls "everything invalid remains invalid").</li>\n<li>Some blocks issued by an old version of the client may be considered invalid\nby a newer version.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Obviously, imposing rule 2 as it is may cause the network to be split into two\nparts: a stakeholder with a stake large enough could update and maintain their\nown chain, rejecting blocks from others, but others would be still able to\nmaintain their chain, rejecting blocks from this stakeholder (since he does not\nhave a majority of stake, and therefore cannot catch up with the rest of the\ncrowd, so his chain is shorter). A simple resolution rule could go like this: if\n95% of the latest 2016 blocks have a newer block version, the blocks with the\nolder version are rejected.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <strong>block version</strong> here and later has the same meaning as the\n<strong>protocol version</strong>.</p>\n<p>It may seem unclear why we would like to make some block version invalid at some\nmoment. The key insight here is that a new feature is actually a restriction on\nwhat we had had previously. For example, currently we have plain old\ntransactions which may contain either PublicKey-based addresses or Script-based\nones. Then at some point we decide to include a third address type (no matter\nwhat its purpose is). Which strategy do we need for verifying a block with a\ntransaction with an address of unknown type? Obviously the only option is not\nverifying this address.</p>\n<p>Then imagine somebody proposing a transaction to this address, possibly doing\nthat with an intention to secure funds from being spent until some conditions\nare met — and then watching them being spent in some other transaction in a\nblock with version 1. This is the point. We cannot make use of a restriction\nwithout waiting for the network to start assuming the old version to be\ndeprecated (since we can only start rejecting blocks when their version is\ndeprecated).</p>\n<p>We also cannot bluntly accept all blocks with a version that is higher than the\none currently adopted, since in our implementation every block has a special field\nwhich is used for storing auxiliary information. An attacker can claim she uses a\nhigher version of the protocol and generate a block whose <code>attributes</code> are polluted\nwith meaningless keys. If we accept it, it will bloat the blockchain.</p>\n<p>This is the motivation for the logic described below.</p>\n<p>In our implementation, a block version can exist in the following states:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adopted</strong>, when the soft fork resolution rule (see below) for a confirmed\nblock version is triggered.</li>\n<li><strong>Confirmed</strong>, when there is an update proposal that contains a confirmed\nversion of the software and this block version. Note that "confirmed version\nof the software" is a technical term defined\n<a href="/cardano/update-mechanism/#soft-fork-updates">elsewhere</a>. If there are\nmultiple block versions where corresponding software is confirmed, but these\nversions aren\'t adopted, we call them <strong>competing</strong>. For instance, there\nmight be versions <code>2.0.0</code>, <code>2.0.1</code>, <code>1.2.0</code>, <code>1.2.1</code>, <code>1.1.1</code> and <code>1.1.2</code>,\nwith the last adopted version being <code>1.1.3</code>. In this case the versions that\nare competing are <code>2.0.0</code>, <code>2.0.1</code>, <code>1.2.0</code> and <code>1.2.1</code>. The older versions\n<code>1.1.1</code> and <code>1.1.2</code> aren\'t competing, because <code>1.1.3</code> is already adopted.</li>\n<li>Everything else. For example, a new block version is proposed, but the\nsoftware version isn\'t confirmed yet. There is no special name for this\nstate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The soft fork resolution rule works as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Informally, a block version becomes <em>adopted</em> when a certain percentage of\nstake (75% in the current implementation, but this may be different in the\nmainnet) creates a block with version <code>X</code>.</li>\n<li>Formally, we do the following. First, recall that by design, our system does\nnot allow rollbacks of blockchain deeper than a certain fixed global\nthreshold <code>k</code>, which allows to define <em>stable</em> stake for each stakeholder as\ntheir stake <code>k</code> blocks ago. When we process genesis block for epoch <code>e</code>, we\ncompute the stable stake of all leaders of all slots from the very beginning\nof the network\'s existence. For each block with version <code>X</code> that is\ncurrently <em>competing</em>, we take all created <em>stable</em> blocks with version <code>X</code>,\ntake set of all leaders of these blocks and accumulate their stakes. If one\nof versions has ≥ 75%, it gets <em>adopted</em>. If more than one version has ≥\n75%, we take one of them deterministically.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that adopted block version can\'t be changed during epoch (only between\nepochs), so all blocks in an epoch are verified according to the same rules\n(because rules are defined by adopted block version). But it\'s wrong to assume\nthat <em>all</em> blocks in an epoch have the same block version. After block version\nis adopted, another block version can become competing and some nodes may create\nblocks with this new version.</p>\n<p>So, gathering everything up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Once the update is confirmed, the protocol version (say <code>0.5.0</code>) can be\nused.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Behavior of nodes that <em>have</em> been updated (i.e. can issue and validate\nblocks with the newer version):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before the soft fork is resolved (i.e. before the resolution rule is\ntriggered), issue blocks with the new version <code>0.5.0</code>, but do not\ninclude any new <code>attributes</code> (if there are any). Treat and validate\nblocks of version <code>0.5.0</code> as blocks of version <code>0.4.0</code>.</li>\n<li>Once the soft fork is resolved, issue and validate blocks per version\n<code>0.5.0</code>, including the new <code>attributes</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Behavior of nodes that <em>have not</em> been updated (i.e. cannot issue and\nvalidate blocks with the newer version):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before the soft fork is resolved, issue and validate blocks per version\n<code>0.4.0</code>.
