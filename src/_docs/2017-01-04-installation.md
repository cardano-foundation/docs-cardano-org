# Installation

## Supported Platforms

Supported platforms are Windows, macOS and Linux. There are
[installers for Windows and macOS](https://daedaluswallet.io/#download),
which include a main node and [Daedalus wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/daedalus).

Linux installer is going to be released soon. Currently, there are two options to
get Cardano SL on Linux:

1. Build from the source code (recommended). Please refer to [How to Build Cardano SL and Daedalus from
Source Code](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/develop/docs/how-to/build-cardano-sl-and-daedalus-from-source-code.md) manual.
2. Use **unofficial** packages for Arch Linux:
   * [cardano-sl](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cardano-sl/)
   * [daedalus-bridge](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/daedalus-bridge/)
   * [daedalus](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/daedalus/)
