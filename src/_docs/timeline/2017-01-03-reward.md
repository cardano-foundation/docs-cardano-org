# Reward Era

After the [Bootstrap era](/timeline/bootstrap), the Reward era will start.
During this time, the network will operate in a completely decentralized,
trustless mode. We expect staking pools to emerge during this era, allowing
stakeholders with little stake to get rewards as stakeholders with large stake
keep their nodes online to maintain the protocol in a decentralized fashion.

The system will receive regular software updates moving forward, and a massive
amount of new features will be released in the near future.
