# PVSS Implementation in Cardano SL

Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS) Scheme used in Cardano SL is based on
"SCRAPE: Scalable Randomness Attested by Public Entities", [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/216.pdf)
by Ignacio Cascudo and Bernardo David. Further we'll refer to this paper's pages,
for example `[6]` means the 6-th page.

This guide describes implementation details of `pvss-haskell`
[library](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell) used by
[cardano-sl](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/65e295599817ec1f52f225810264d856f882fbb7/core/Pos/Crypto/SecretSharing.hs#L1)
library.

## What is PVSS

The core idea of VSS Scheme is an ability of participants to verify their own
shares, for successful reconstruction of the secret (previously distributed by a
dealer among the participants). But core idea of PVSS Scheme is that not just
the participants can verify their shares, but that anybody can verify that the
participants received correct shares. So it's required (for our reconstruction
protocol) that participants not only release their shares but also that they
provide a proof of correctness for each share released (`[9]`).

We use `t-out-of-n` reconstruction scheme (`[8]`), where `n` is a number of
participants and `t` is a threshold number, so any subset of `t+1` shares can be
used to successfully recover the secret.

So, the protocol consists of four fundamental phases (`[8]`):

1.  setup,
2.  distribution,
3.  verification,
4.  reconstruction.

## Setup

Each participant `Pi` must generate its private key `SKi` and register its public key `PKi`.

## Distribution

First of all, we prepare a new escrowing context. To do it we need a
[threshold](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L76)
value mentioned above and a list of [public
keys](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L175)
of participants. Result of this operation is
[`Escrow`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L120)
value which includes:

1.  [Extra generator](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L85),
2.  [Polynomial](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/Polynomial.hs#L24),
3.  [Secret](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L89),
4.  [Proof](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/DLEQ.hs#L39).

Extra generator is based on a
[Point](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/ECC.hs#L92)
([Elliptic Curve
Point](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite-openssl-0.6/docs/Crypto-OpenSSL-ECC.html#t:EcPoint)).
We use `prime256v1` elliptic curve, see
[RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5480.txt).

Polynomial is a group of coefficient starting from the smallest degree (these
coefficients are
[Scalar](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite-0.23/docs/Crypto-PubKey-ECC-P256.html#t:Scalar)
values).

Secret is based on a
[Point](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/ECC.hs#L92)
as well, actually it's the [first
element](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L140)
of polynomial mentioned above.

from a
[challenge](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L142),
[raw
secret](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L140)
and
[DLEQ-parameters](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L143).

Challenge is based on [cryptographic
hash](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/ECC.hs#L125).

After that we have to [finish escrow
creation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L168).
List of participants' public keys is used to [create encrypted
shares](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L202)
and
[commitments](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L188).
Encrypted share includes:

1.  [Share ID](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L82),
2.  [Value](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L99)
    encrypted by participant's public key,
3.  [Proof](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L99)
    that this share is valid (`[8]`).

## Verification

Now commitments and encrypted shares can be published among participants. Due
the public nature of PVSS scheme anyone who knows public keys can [verify
decrypted
shares](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L249)
via hashes matching (`[8]`).

## Reconstruction

First of all, participant must [decrypt encrypted
share](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L230)
using [keys
pair](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/ECC.hs#L59)
with its
[private](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/ECC.hs#L80)
and
[public](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/ECC.hs#L84)
keys. To obtain DLEQ value, we use `prime256v1` [curve
generator](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/ECC.hs#L156).
As a result, we get
[`DecryptedShare`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L109).
Its structure is the same as encrypted share.

Since decrypted share contains a proof, we can be sure that decrypted share is
the same as encrypted one, there's [verification
function](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L260)
for it. To [do
it](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/DLEQ.hs#L74)
we use DLEQ value and [proof from the decrypted
share](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L263).
Actual verifying is a
[comparison](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/DLEQ.hs#L77)
of the
[hash](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS/ECC.hs#L146)
of DLEQ points.

Now, if we have `t+1` decrypted shares we can [recover a
secret](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L285).

Recovered secret can be
[verified](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L267)
as well, so we can be sure that secret recovered is the same escrow. To do it,
we need not just a proof and a secret, but
[commitments](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L268)
as well (actually, the [first
one](https://github.com/input-output-hk/pvss-haskell/blob/3c3926142c017255aa683256a1c8dd0c36cb9365/src/Crypto/PVSS.hs#L278).

## VSS Certificate

As [said
earlier](/cardano/differences/#coin-tossing-and-verifiable-secret-sharing), one
of the challenges while using a PVSS scheme is associating the public key used
for signing with the [public
key](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/fefc39f058f5a053fc1e59bc3594bdadf7699ca0/core/Pos/Crypto/SecretSharing.hs#L57)
used for VSS scheme. This is solved by introducing [VSS
certificate](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f0de5f1dd31cc4afb0c67a24deca713cf6304814/core/Pos/Core/Vss/Types.hs#L46).

VSS certificate includes:

1.  Public key used for the VSS scheme (e.g. [VSS
    key](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/fefc39f058f5a053fc1e59bc3594bdadf7699ca0/core/Pos/Crypto/SecretSharing.hs#L57)).
2.  Public key used for signing (e.g. [signing
    key](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f0de5f1dd31cc4afb0c67a24deca713cf6304814/core/Pos/Core/Vss/Types.hs#L51)).
3.  Index of an expiry epoch (e.g. the last epoch when this certificate was
    valid).
4.  Signature of a pair `(A,B)`, where `A` is a VSS key and `B` is an epoch
    index.

Initially, all stakeholders with enough stake to participate in randomness
generation (we call them [richmen](/glossary/#richman)) [have their own
certificates](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/35c6bff7409472352140f5207a7c79c59d8eaa8f/ssc/Pos/Ssc/GodTossing/Workers.hs#L163).
When a new stakeholder having enough stake appears, or when an existing
certificate expires, a new certificate should be generated and [submitted to the
network](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/35c6bff7409472352140f5207a7c79c59d8eaa8f/ssc/Pos/Ssc/GodTossing/Workers.hs#L166).
Other nodes accept this certificate if it's valid and if the node has enough
stake. Certificates are stored in blocks.

Please note that VSS certificate must be stable before usage! If an epoch we
retrieve certificates for is the first one (i.e. has index `0`), stable
certificates are [genesis
ones](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/35c6bff7409472352140f5207a7c79c59d8eaa8f/ssc/Pos/Ssc/GodTossing/Functions.hs#L139).
Otherwise stable certificate are [non-expired certificates for the last known
slot](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/35c6bff7409472352140f5207a7c79c59d8eaa8f/ssc/Pos/Ssc/GodTossing/Functions.hs#L141).
