Running a stake pool requires a certain amount of technical expertise. Stake pool operators are expected to ensure that their node is running 24/7, both to support the operation of the Cardano network and to provide a high quality of service to their delegators. Stake pools on the Cardano network are not moderated in any way, but poor stake pool performance will naturally lead to reduced rewards, a poor stake pool ranking, and fewer delegators.

Stake pool operators should be aware that there is a fee for registering a stake pool on the Cardano network. This is a security measure to disincentivize the creation of multiple pools by malicious actors.

## Suggested skills for stake pool operators
* Operational knowledge of how to [run a Cardano node](../cardano-node.md)
* Server administration skills
* System operation skills

## Hardware requirements
Stake pool operators also require the necessary technical infrastructure to run a Cardano node 24/7. There are no strict guidelines in this regard, and operators should consider their personal expertise, potential operating costs, and availability of any hardware they choose to use to run their node.

## Supported platforms
Cardano nodes can be run on Linux, Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), Mac, and Windows platforms. Stake pool operators will have to use one of these operating systems to run their stake pool node.
