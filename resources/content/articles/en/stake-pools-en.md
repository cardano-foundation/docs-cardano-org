[Stake pools](link to stake pool page) are nodes on the Cardano network, owned and managed by stake pool operators who have the technical skills and infrastructure to ensure maximum node uptime. In addition to contributing to the operation of the Cardano network by producing blocks, stake pools provide a service to users who wish to [delegate their stake](link to stake delegation page) and [earn rewards](link to stake delegation page), but are unable or unwilling to run a node of their own 24/7.

As a service provider, stake pool operators can choose to take a margin of the rewards earned by a stake pool to cover their running costs, or to make stake pool operation profitable.

Cryptocurrency exchanges looking to run their own stake pool or provide delegation as a service should refer to the documentation [for exchanges](link to exchanges section).
