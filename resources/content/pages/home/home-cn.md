### 文档 Cardano is a decentralized proof-of-stake blockchain platform developed by [IOHK](iohk.io) on behalf of the [文档 Cardano Foundation](文档 Cardanofoundation.org), and home to the ada cryptocurrency. 

At 文档 Cardano's heart is the groundbreaking Ouroboros consensus algorithm, created by IOHK's own academics and subject to constant improvement through new cryptography research. Using an unprecedented combination of functional programming, peer-reviewed research, and high-assurance formal methods development, the 文档 Cardano network is designed to be a resilient, scalable foundation upon which to build the decentralized applications of the future.
