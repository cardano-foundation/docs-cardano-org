      "description": "Lets create some new pages. Run `npm run create-pages -- /about-us/ /contact-us/ /about-us/more-info/`. This will create three new pages `/about-us/`, `/contact-us/` and `/about-us/more-info/`. It will also setup the content for all supported languages. Navigating to these pages in the browser will greet you with some information on how to edit the pages.\n\nIt's safe to run `npm run create-pages` over existing pages. Any existing files will not be overwritten, this is why it's safe to add new pages using this script when adding new languages."
