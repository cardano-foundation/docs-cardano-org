See [configuration documentation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/gatsby-starter-iohk-default#configuration) for full reference.\n\nLets start by adding a new language in `availableLanguages` after `en`. First of all stop any processes running the site such as `npm start` etc.\n\n```JavaScript\n{\n  \"key\": \"fr\",\n  \"label\": \"FranÃ§ais\",\n  \"flag\": \"ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·\",\n  \"locale\": \"fr_FR\"\n}\n```"

This will create the additional markdown we require for `fr`. If we tried to run `npm start` prior to creating the markdown for the language we would have got an error letting us know that no content existed for the home page of that language."

For a handful of languages this is performant enough, however for dozens of languages a more performant approach may be to resolve the content using the Gatsby node API. This of course depends on the amount of localized content."
